In the case of Friction stir welding the heat is generated by the frictional force generated by the rotation of the tool along with axial pressure leads to metal joining, therefore the rate of heat transfer, its distribution has to be studied. In this work Mg alloys AZ31B and AZ91B are used for FSW according to taguchi’s L9 orthogonal array with three process parameters tool rotational speed from 1000rpm to 1200 rpm, welding speed from 20mm/min to 30mm/min and tool tilt angle from 1º to 3º.Three sets of welding have been performednamely AZ31B/AZ31B similar joints, AZ91B/AZ91B similar joint and AZ31B/AZ91B dissimilar joints respectively. The temperature has been measured using a contact probe thermocouple and temperature distribution at each second is calculated and the influence on final weld properties has been discussed with the help of ANSYS software. In ANSYS element type SOLID 90is used for thermal analysis which has single degree of freedom, temperature on its each node. The corresponding microstructure of joints with highest UTS and lowest UTS was obtained for validating the results. © 2020 Alpha Publishers.

It is also well known that FS heat results in softening but the reduction in strength is alloy, temper and location dependent. However, the combined effect of softening and hooking on fracture strength has not been very clear. Furthermore, the dependence of the mode of fracture on the type of alloy and how this affects the fracture strength have not been studied. In the present experiments, a series of FSLW of AA6060-T5 and AZ31B-H24 alloys were conducted and fracture strength values were determined. For both alloys, rotation speed has a dominant effect on the hook size. For the case of AA6060, FS softening has limited the fracture strength, when hook size approaches zero and the welds are sound. It has been observed that a hook starts to reduce the fracture strength significantly when its size reaches a critical value. The obtained lap joint strength of 60-70% of the base metal UTS when hook size approaches zero could be regarded as being high. This is in contrast to ∼30% for AZ31B FSL welds. This difference can be explained by the amount of local plastic deformation to relax the stress intensification near the lapping end.","Fracture strength; Hooking; Local plasticity; Softening","Alloys; Fracture; Friction; Gas welding; Hooks; Mechanical properties; Tribology; Welds; Base metals; Combined effect; Critical value; Detrimental effects; Fracture strengths; Friction stir; Hooking; Lap joint; Local plastic deformation; Local plasticity; Location dependents; Mg alloy; Mode of fracture; Rotation speed; Softening; Friction stir welding","","","","","","","Thomas W., Johnson K.I., Wiesner C.S., Advanced Engineering Materials, 5, (2003); Cao X., Jahazi M., Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on ""Trends in Welding Research"", (2009); Cantin G.M.D., David S.A., Thomas W.M., Lara-Curzio E., Babu S.S., Science and Technology of Welding and Joining, 10, (2005); Ericsson M., Jin L., Sandstrom R., International Journal of Fatigue, 29, (2007); Fersini D., Pirondi A., Engineering Fracture Mechanics, 75, (2008); Lee C.Y., Lee W.B., Kim J.W., Choi D.H., Yeon Y.M., Jung S.B., Journal of Materials Science, 43; Buffa G., Campanile G., Fratini L., Prisco A., Materials Science and Engineering A, 519, (2009); Dubourg L., Merati A., Jahazi M., Materials and Design, 31, (2010)","","","","Shaping Form.

After friction stir welding (FSW) both yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) were observed to be lower but strain hardening exponent became much higher due to the presence of recrystallized grains in the stirred zone (SZ) and thermomechanically affected zone (TMAZ). The left-hand thread pin tool rotating clockwise generated good FSWed joints and mechanical properties due to the downward material flow close to the pin surface, while the right-hand thread pin tool turning clockwise caused an upward material flow and resulted in inferior joints. The YS and UTS increased and strain hardening exponent decreased with increasing welding speed. The YS as a function of grain sizes obeyed the Hall-Petch relationship well, and it also increased with decreasing rotational rate. Both YS and UTS were observed to increase linearly with increasing weld pitch (a ratio of welding speed to rotational rate). A significantly higher YS of ∼170. MPa was achieved at a high weld pitch of 1.2. mm/rev, in comparison with that (∼110. MPa) using a weld pitch ranging from 0.0039 to 0.24. mm/rev. All the FSWed AZ31B-H24 joints failed in-between the SZ and TMAZ. Dimple-like ductile fracture characteristics appeared in the base metal, while some cleavage-like flat facets together with dimples and river marking were observed in the FSWed samples. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Friction stir welding; Magnesium alloy; Microstructure; Pin tool thread orientation; Tensile properties; Weld pitch","Clocks; Ductile fracture; Friction; Magnesium alloys; Microstructure; Research laboratories; Strain hardening; Tensile strength; Tribology; Welds; Friction stir; Friction-stir-welding; Pin tool thread orientations; Pin tools; Rotational rates; Strain-hardening exponent; Thermomechanically affected zones; Ultimate tensile strength; Weld pitch; Welding speed; Friction stir welding","","","","","","","Kim S.H., You B.S., Yong C.D., Seo Y.M., Mater.

The L9 Taguchi design considering an orthogonal array consists of 3 factors and 3 levels was used for experimentation. The rotational speed of tool, transverse speed and angle of tilt of the tool are selected as welding parameters. The welding parameters influence on responses namely Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) and hardness has been analyzed using ANOVA. The analysis results showed transverse speed as the predominant welding parameter affecting tensile strength, hardness, and weld quality.

Friction stir welding (FSW) resulted in the presence of recrystallized grains and the relevant drop in hardness in the stir zone (SZ). The base alloy contained a strong crystallographic texture with basal planes (0002) largely parallel to the rolling sheet surface and 1120 directions aligned in the rolling direction (RD). After FSW the basal planes in the SZ were slightly tilted toward the TD determined from the sheet normal direction (or top surface) and also slightly inclined toward the RD determined from the transverse direction (or cross section) due to the intense shear plastic flow near the pin surface. The prismatic planes (1010) and pyramidal planes (1011) formed fiber textures. After FSW both the strength and ductility of the AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy decreased with a joint efficiency in-between about 75 and 82 pct due to the changes in both grain structure and texture, which also weakened the strain rate dependence of tensile properties. The welding speed and rotational rate exhibited a stronger effect on the YS than the UTS. Despite the lower ductility, strain-hardening exponent and hardening capacity, a higher YS was obtained at a higher welding speed and lower rotational rate mainly due to the smaller recrystallized grains in the SZ arising from the lower heat input. © 2012 The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.","","Alloys; Ductility; Magnesium alloys; Recrystallization (metallurgy); Textures; Welding; AZ31 magnesium alloy; Basal planes; Base alloys; Crystallographic textures; Fiber texture; Friction stir; Hardening capacities; Heat input; Mg alloy; Normal direction; Prismatic planes; Pyramidal planes; Recrystallized grains; Rolling direction; Rolling sheet; Rotational rates; Stir zones; Strain rate dependence; Strain-hardening exponent; Top surface; Transverse directions; Welding speed; Friction stir welding","","","","","NSERC-Discovery; RRC; Ryerson Research Chair; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Canada Foundation for Innovation, CFI; AUTO21 Network of Centres of Excellence","The authors would like to thank the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and AUTO21 Network of Centers of Excellence for providing financial support.

The effects of the welding process on the mechanical properties and microstructural joints were investigated by metallographic analysis by light microscopy, Vickers microhardness tests, tensile tests at room temperature and analysis of the fracture zone after tensile tests by means of a scanning electron microscope (SEM). From the results it is shown that in the technique with double welding, on both sides, compared with the technique welding from one side only, the mixing zone presents a greater homogeneity, a minor dimension of the grain and a hardness with symmetrical distribution of the profiles. In addition, macroscopic defects present in single joints have been significantly reduced in those with welding from both sides. From the tensile tests, there was an increase in the tensile strength (UTS) of about 9% comparing double with single pass and a final elongation (EU) increased by 25% with the arrangement FSW-AS AS than the individual. From the analysis of the fracture zone with a scanning electron microscope at high resolution, it is noted that the fracture is of type transgranular in both samples welded from two sides.","Friction stir welding both side welded; Mg AZ31; Microstructure characterization light alloys; SEM","Friction stir welding; Magnesium alloys; Mechanical properties; Scanning electron microscopy; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; AZ31; AZ31B magnesium alloys; Friction stir welding(FSW); Light alloys; Macroscopic defects; Metallographic analysis; Room temperature; Vickers microhardness tests; Welding","","","","","","","Cao P., Qian M., Stjohn D.H., Effect of manganese on grain refinement of Mg-AI based alloys, Scripta Materialia, 54, pp. 1853-1858, (2006); Xunhonga W., Kuaishe W., Microstructure and properties of friction stir butt-welded AZ31 magnesium alloy, Materials Science and Engineering A, 431, pp. 114-117, (2006); Buffa G., Campanile G., Fratini L., Prisco A., Friction stir welding of lap joints: Influence of process parameters on the metallurgical and mechanical properties, Materials Science and Engineering A, 519, pp. 19-26, (2009); Chang C.I., Lee C.J., Huang J.C., Relationship between grain size and working strain rate and temperature during friction stir processing in AZ3I Mg alloy, Scripta Materialia, 51, pp. 509-514, (2004); Darras B.M., Khraisheh M.K., Abu-Farha F.K., Omar M.A., Friction stir processing of commercial AZ31 magnesium alloy, Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 191, pp. 77-81, (2007); Sutton B.Y., Reynolds A., Taylor R., Micro structural studies of friction stir welds in 2024-T3 aluminum, Mater.

Further design flexibility can be obtained by joining the Mg alloys to other materials with outstanding performance, such as aluminum alloys. In this study, Al-6062 and Magnesium AZ31B have been joined through friction stir welding (FSW) using the high-speed steel (HSS) tool. The impact of two important process parameters, including spindle speed and welding speed, has been evaluated on ultimate tensile strength (UTS). In addition, the effect of the advancing side has also been assessed. Analysis of variance has been performed based on full factorial design. For maximum UTS, the study suggests spindle speed and welding speed of 100 rpm and 50 mm/min respectively with magnesium on the advancing side. The weld strength is 110% higher than that of magnesium-magnesium weld joint.  © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.","Friction Stir Welding (FSW); Intermetallic Compound (IMC); Microstructure","Aluminum alloys; Aluminum compounds; Friction; Intermetallics; Magnesium alloys; Research laboratories; Tensile strength; Welds; Advancing side; Aluminum (Al); Friction stir welding; Friction-stir-welding; Intermetallic compound; Intermetallics compounds; Magnesium AZ31B; Spindle speed; Ultimate tensile strength; Welding speed; Friction stir welding","","","","","","","Abbassi F., Srinivasan M., Loganathan C., Narayanasamy R., Gupta M., Experimental and numerical analyses of magnesium alloy hot workability, J.

Results indicated that the use of the 1000 rpm rotation speed of the tool and 40 mm/min traverse speed led to increased weld strength and corrosion resistance. Owing to more heat generation, the surface of every friction stirs welded joint became rougher, and a keyhole can be observed. A maximum temperature of 311 C was observed for 1000 rpm of rotation speed and 40 mm/min of traverse speed, and a minimum temperature of 191 C was observed for 600 rpm of rotation speed and 80 mm/min of traverse speed. A minor tunnel defect can be partially observed at traverse speeds of 60 mm/min; the size of the tunnel defect becomes more prominent as the traverse speed rises to 80 mm/min. The joint with little or no defects was extracted at any rotational tool speed and a low traverse speed of 40 mm/min. The maximum value of UTS of 121 MPa was observed due to the better mechanical interlocking phenomena. It is approximately 41% of UTS of Al alloy AA6061 and 50% of UTS of Mg alloy AZ31B. Frictional heat, heavy plastic distortion, and grain refinement in the nugget zone are the reasons for the higher hardness value found mostly in weld nuggets. The FSW specimens indicate a primarily brittle type of failure, and a fracture of the cleavage type was seen with an excessive volume of intermetallic layer. Compared to both alloy side weld regions, the Mg alloy area weld zone was more corroded and had more cracks and gaps than the Al alloy side. © 2022 AIP Publishing.

The current research endeavors to synthesize nanocomposites based on magnesium (Mg), specifically AZ31B, by employing Friction Stir Processing (FSP) and integrating nano-titanium carbide (TiC) as a reinforcing element. Additionally, the impact of various FSP parameters, encompassing transverse speeds (35 and 70 mm/min) and tool rotation speeds (850 and 1700 rpm), on the metallurgical, wear, and mechanical properties of the developed MMMCs was investigated. The microstructural analysis revealed that employing the FSP technique led to a uniform dispersion of nano-TiC reinforcement particles within the base matrix of the AZ31B Mg alloy. This concurrent distribution played a crucial role in both refining and evolving the grain sizes, subsequently leading to improvements in the composites’s mechanical and wear characteristics. To be more specific, the grain size witnessed a reduction by nearly 18 times, the microhardness increased by approximately 2.54 times, and the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) showed a 2.08-fold increase when compared to the base alloy. Furthermore, in contrast to the base material characterized by an adhesive wear mechanism, the presence of scratches indicates that the abrasive wear mechanism predominated in the case of the AZ31B/TiC nanocomposite. The outcome of the results depicts that the nanocomposite fabricated at a tool rotation speed of 1700 rpm and 70 mm/min transverse shows better mechanical and tribological characteristics than other developed composites and the base alloy. © IMechE 2024.","Magnesium metal matrix composites metallurgical characteristics; mechanical characteristics; wear","Adhesives; Friction; Friction stir welding; Grain size and shape; Magnesium alloys; Magnesium compounds; Metallic matrix composites; Particle size analysis; Tensile strength; Titanium carbide; Tribology; Wear of materials; Base alloys; Friction stir processing; Grainsize; Magnesium metal; Magnesium metal matrix composite metallurgical characteristic; Matrix composite; Mechanical characteristics; Metal matrix; Metallurgical characteristics; Tool rotation speed; Nanocomposites","","","","","","","Prasad S.V.S., Prasad S.B., Verma K., Et al., The role and significance of Magnesium in modern-day research-a review, J Magnes Alloy, 10, pp. 1-61, (2022); Liu B., Yang J., Zhang X., Et al., Development and application of magnesium alloy parts for automotive OEMs: a review, J Magnes Alloy, 11, pp. 15-47, (2023); Yang Y., Xiong X., Chen J., Et al., Research advances in magnesium and magnesium alloys worldwide in 2020, J Magnes Alloy, 9, pp. 705-747, (2021); Parveez B., Kittur M.I., Badruddin I.A., Et al., Scientific advancements in composite materials for aircraft applications: a review, Polymers, 14, (2022); Borgaonkar A.V., Syed I., Sonawane S.H., Fabrication and characterization of composite MoS<sub>2</sub>-TiO<sub>2</sub> coating material, Proc IMechE, Part C: J Mechanical Engineering Science, 236, pp. 1838-1849, (2021); Kumar Y., Singh H., Effect of sintering routes on CIP/EIP – Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composite magnetic abrasive for chemo-mechanical magneto-rheological finishing of aluminium 6061, Proc IMechE, Part C: J Mechanical Engineering Science, 237, pp. 374-405, (2022); Girish G., Investigation into microstructural evolution, mechanical and tribological properties of an aluminum surface composite developed using a severe plastic deformation technique, Proc IMechE, Part C: J Mechanical Engineering Science, 237, pp. 5634-5652, (2023); Mishra R.S., Ma Z.Y., Friction stir welding and processing, Mater Sci Eng R Reports, 50, pp. 1-78, (2005); Sagar P., Handa A., Exploring the mechanical, metallurgical, and fracture characteristics of hybrid- reinforced magnesium metal matrix composite synthesized via friction stir processing route, Proc IMechE, Part L: J Materials: Design and Applications, (2023); Sagar P., Handa A., Role of tool rotational speed on the tribological characteristics of magnesium based AZ61A/TiC composite developed via friction stir processing route, J Achiev Mater Manuf Eng, 101, pp. 60-75, (2020); Sejani D., Li W., Patel V., Stationary shoulder friction stir welding–low heat input joining technique: a review in comparison with conventional FSW and bobbin tool FSW, Crit Rev Solid State Mater Sci, 47, pp. 865-914, (2022); Patel V., Li W., Xu Y., Stationary shoulder tool in friction stir processing: a novel low heat input tooling system for magnesium alloy, Mater Manuf Process, 34, pp. 177-182, (2019); Patel V., Li W., Wen Q., Surface analysis of stationary shoulder friction stir processed AZ31B magnesium alloy, Mater Sci Technol, 35, pp. 628-631, (2019); Li W., Niu P.L., Yan S.R., Et al., Improving microstructural and tensile properties of AZ31B magnesium alloy joints by stationary shoulder friction stir welding, J Manuf Process, 37, pp. 159-167, (2019); Patel V., Li W., Wen Q., Et al., Homogeneous grain refinement and ductility enhancement in AZ31B magnesium alloy using friction stir processing, Magnesium technology 2019.

In this study, ultrasonic-stationary shoulder assisted friction stir welding (U-SSFSW) was employed to join the dissimilar alloys of AZ31B Mg and 6061-T6 Al. Radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) was used to model the relationships between the inputs of welding speed, rotating speed and ultrasonic power and the output of ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of U-SSFSW joint. After that, grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm was used to explore the maximum UTS and the corresponding optimal process parameters. The maximum UTS reached 158 MPa under the RBFNN-GWO system optimized process parameters. The microstructure and fracture behavior were analyzed to clarify the superiorities of the optimal process parameters and the enhancement mechanism of U-SSFSW technique under the optimized parameters. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Friction stir welding;

The engineering ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation (El) of the CoreFlowed sample was 258 ± 5 MPa and 22.3 ± 0.8%. The El was significantly increased by 58% with equivalent UTS compared to the as-received material. Such a good combination of strength and ductility is attributed to grain refinement with heterogeneity, texture weakening, and homogeneously redistributed second phase particles. © 2023 The Author(s)","CoreFlow<sup>TM</sup>; Ductility; EBSD; Mg alloys; Stationary shoulder friction stir extrusion","Aluminum alloys; Ductility; Friction; Friction stir welding; Grain refinement; Grain size and shape; Hot rolling; Magnesium alloys; Manganese alloys; Tensile strength; Textures; Wire; Zinc alloys; CoreflowTM; EBSD; Finer grains; Friction stir; Hot-rolled; Mg alloy; Rolled plates; Stationary shoulder friction stir extrusion; Strength and ductilities; Ultimate tensile strength; Extrusion","","","","","UKRI MRC, (MR/T019123/1); Henry Royce Institute; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/P02470X/1, EP/P025285/1, EP/R00661X/1, EP/S019367/1); University of Sheffield, (EP/T006390/1, EP/T02593X/1)","This work was supported by the UKRI MRC Future Leaders Fellowship, [MR/T019123/1].

This paper presents tensile and fatigue crack growth rate (FCGR) behaviors of friction stir AZ31B-H24 magnesium alloy welded joints produced using two different pins, namely cylindrical and square pins at varying tool rotation rates of 910 rpm, 1500 rpm and 2280 rpm. Experiments conducted in this study included microstructural observations, Vickers microhardness measurements, tensile tests, residual stress measurements and FCGR tests. The results showed that increasing tool rotation rate increased ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the welded joints and the highest values of UTS were achieved at 2280 rpm giving 229.0 MPa for the cylindrical pin and 200.3 MPa for the square pin. In the middle tension M(T) fatigue specimens, FCGR of FSW joint fabricated using the square pin at 2280 rpm was lower in comparison to the weld produced by the cylindrical pin. Subsequently, in single edge crack tension (SECT) specimens, the higher FCGRs were observed as the crack propagated across heat affected zone (HAZ) followed by the crack growth retardation in the weld nugget zone (WNZ). These fatigue crack growth rate behaviors were likely dictated by the weld microstructure and residual stresses. © 2024 The Author(s)","Fatigue crack growth rate; FSW; Magnesium alloy; Pin geometry; Strength","","","","","","Kemenristek-DIKTI; Marine and Fisheries Education Center; Universitas Gadjah Mada, UGM","This work was carried out under research grant, named PDD with contract number: 1934/UN1/DITLIT/Dit-Lit/PT.01.03/2022.

Consequently, a relatively homogeneous microstructure is obtained in BFSW welds compared to the conventional FSW. In the current study, we performed BFSW bead-on-plate experiments on Mg alloy AZ31B with the goal to study evolution of microstructure and resulting tensile behavior of the welded material. We used three different combinations of intense process parameters which were intentionally chosen to be outside of the norm for BFSW i.e., tool rotational speeds >1500 rpm and constant translational speed of 10 mm/min. The BFS weldments showed the classic heat affected zone (HAZ), a small but discernible thermomechanical affected zone (TMAZ) and a large, near rectangular stir zone (SZ). The SZ consisted of a bimodal microstructure similar to the base material but some degree of grain refinement was also observed, which was more prominent on the retreating side of SZ. BFS welded specimen showed maximum of 67% and 48% joint efficiency (ratio of weld UTS to base material UTS) at room temperature and 200 °C, respectively. Fracture of specimens occurred in TMAZ/SZ interface and SZ, in room and elevated temperature tested specimens, respectively. Large number of twins were observed near fracture surface of the room temperature tensile tested specimen while coalescence of microcracks led to fracture at elevated temperature. © 2022 The Authors","AZ31; Bobbin friction stir welding; Severe plastic deformation","Fracture; Friction; Grain refinement; Heat affected zone; Magnesium alloys; Microcracks; Microstructure; Research laboratories; Tensile strength; AZ31; Base material; Bobbin friction stir welding; Elevated temperature; Friction stir; Friction-stir-welding; Severe plastic deformations; Stir zones; Tensile behaviors; Thermo-mechanical; Friction stir welding","","","","","Mechanical Engineering Department at Texas A&M University; Qatar National Library; Qatar National Research Fund, QNRF","Funding text 1: This publication was made possible by the grant NPRP No. 8-856-2-364 from the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of The Qatar Foundation).
