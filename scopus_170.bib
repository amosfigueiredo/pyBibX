	abstract = {The term " Friction stir welding," abbreviated as "FSW," refers to a cutting-edge technology that has found widespread application in the metallurgical sector. In this piece of work, a complete discussion is presented on the most recent developments in the numerical analysis of FSW. These developments cover subjects like welding processes, and they are the subject of the discussion. In particular, the findings of this research lay a solid groundwork for future research into the phenomena that lie behind each of the three sub problems that are associated with FSW. Specifically, fully coupled thermo-mechanical models are used to study how different tool shapes influence the temperature distributions and material deformations that occur during (FSW). In addition to shedding light on various critical weld production methods, the results of the study also provide crucial insight into the mechanisms that are behind the construction of the FSW of steel, titanium, and other difficult materials. Nowadays, many techniques, such as computational solid mechanics (CSM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodologies, have been used to characterise FSW principles and model heat generation. Simulation of material flow has also been studied with regrard to numerical modelling approach. The results that have been summarised to understand the sophisticated numerical analytic techniques for FSW of a variety of different materials. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature 2023.},

	abstract = {To achieve high-strength friction stir welded joints for large/extra-large thick plate structures, the contradiction between increased softening of the weld due to increased heat input and the formation of weld defects due to reduced heat input must be overcome. In this study, a novel strategy was proposed to solve the above contradiction by tilting the tool toward the retreating side during the welding process. This approach selectively reduces the heat input in the high-temperature zones of the weld and thus improves the joint efficiency. The combination of the finite element simulation with the test results of the mechanical properties shows that the peak temperature on the retreating side has a stronger negative correlation with the mechanical properties of the welded joint than the peak temperature on the advancing side. Tilting the tool toward the retreating side helps to reduce the peak temperature on the retreating side, but the mechanical properties of the welded joint exhibit an initial increase followed by a decrease. When the lateral tool-tilt angle toward the retreating side is 0.75°, the efficiency of the friction stir weld of 18 mm thick aluminum alloy reaches 75.1 %. This efficiency represents an increase of >10 % compared to the joint efficiencies of thick plate friction stir welded joints documented in the existing literature. It is expected that this innovative friction stir welding strategy will be widely used for large/extra-large thick plate structures in the future. © 2024 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers},

	abstract = {Die-cast Al–Si aluminium alloys are increasingly used in the lightweight design of automobiles; their mechanical properties under dynamic loading are crucial and thus must be investigated. The original Johnson–Cook (J–C) constitutive model does not accurately predict the mechanical properties of this alloy, which further affects the reliability of subsequent analysis and calculations. To improve the predictive accuracy of the constitutive model and investigate the dynamic mechanical properties of this alloy, high-speed tensile tests of die-casting aluminium alloy Al–10Si–yCu–xMn–zFe are conducted. The tests are executed at room temperature using a universal electrical testing machine and a high-velocity testing system in a wide strain rate range of 1–800 s−1. The tensile deformation behaviour of this alloy at various strain rates is investigated. The experiments show that the flow stress of the alloy gradually increases with strain and varies significantly with the strain rate. The J–C model is unsuitable for predicting the flow stress of this alloy owing to its unsatisfactory goodness-of-fit. To accurately predict the flow stress of die-cast Al–Si aluminium alloys, we propose a new model based on experiments. Unlike other models, the proposed model incorporates the critical strain and flow stress limit value, which allows the flow stress to be predicted more precisely at various strain rates over a wide strain range of 0–0.17. The experimental data of other die-cast Al–Si alloys validate our model. The goodness-of-fit of the proposed model for this alloy is higher than that of the J–C model, which demonstrates that our model outperforms existing models in terms of estimation accuracy. © 2023},

	abstract = {As a novel solid-state additive manufacturing technology, Additive friction stir deposition (AFSD) has attracted extensive research attention due to its ability to form microstructures similar to forging. Currently, research efforts have focused on process mechanisms, process features, and applications. In terms of process mechanism, the material flow mechanism between the transition and deposition zones, heat generation and transfer mechanism, microstructure evolution mechanism, and the interaction mechanism between process parameters, material flow, and thermal field evolution in the AFSD process have been revealed. In terms of process characteristics, research has found that AFSD exhibits macroscopic features such as solid-state, near-net shaping, and interface mixing, as well as refined and equiaxed microstructure features, which significantly affect the mechanical properties of AFSD specimens in terms of hardness and tensile strength. In terms of applications, AFSD has demonstrated extensive potential in the fields of additive manufacturing, coating and composite material manufacturing, and repair, and is applicable to a range of metal materials. Considering the research progress in process mechanisms, process features, and applications, it is apparent that the exploration of AFSD is still in its early stages, and its high efficiency, high quality, and low energy consumption additive characteristics endow it with enormous development potential. © 2024 Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society.

	abstract = {To address the problem of tribological failure in an aircraft piston pump valve plate pair, the friction and wear properties of the valve plate pair materials (W9Mo3Cr4V-HAl61-4-3-1) of an axial piston pump at a certain speed and load were studied using a disc-ring tester under lubrication with No. 15 aviation hydraulic oil. The results show that the friction coefficient (COF) fluctuated in the range of 0.019~0.120 when the load (L) increased from 30 N to 120 N, and the speed increased from 100 r/min to 500 r/min. With the increase in the rotational speed, the COF of the valve plate pair decreased first and then increased. When the rotation speed (V) was 300 r/min, the relative COF was the smallest. Under L lower than 60 N, abrasive wear was the main wear mechanism. Under L higher than 90 N, the main wear mechanism was adhesive wear but mild oxidation wear also occurred. In addition, based on the V, L, radius (R), and test duration (T), which affected COF, the random forest regression (RFR) algorithm, the bagging regression (BR) algorithm, and the extra trees regression (ETR) algorithm were used as machine learning methods to predict the COF of the valve plate pair. Mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2) were used to evaluate its performance, with the results showing that the ETR prediction model was the best method for predicting COF. The results of the machine learning also showed that the contributions of V, L, R, and T were 43.56%, 36.76%, 13.13%, and 6.55%, respectively, indicating that V had the greatest influence on the COF of the W9Mo3Cr4V/HAl61-4-3-1 friction pair. This study is expected to provide support for the rapid development of new valve plate pair materials. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The flow drill screw (FDS) process has been widely used for joining plates and profiles in automotive body structures owing to its advantage of one-sided accessibility. A challenge in practical applications is how to quickly and accurately obtain the mechanical behavior of steel-aluminum FDS joints with different plate thicknesses and loading conditions. This study proposes a method that integrates experimental tests, numerical simulations, and artificial neural network (ANN) models to predict the mechanical behavior of joints. An experimentally validated joint numerical model was first used to generate the training and testing datasets of the ANN model. Based on the obtained datasets, two types of ANN models were set up. The classification model was employed to classify the failure modes of the joints, and the regression model was used to predict the peak force, failure displacement, and force–displacement curves. In the regression model, three data processing approaches were employed to improve the prediction accuracy of the curves. The best performance metrics of the model were achieved when the force–displacement curves in four failure modes were predicted independently. The feasibility of applying the well-trained ANN model to untrained datasets was successfully demonstrated. The failure modes of four untrained cases were correctly classified. The predicted force–displacement curves were in good agreement with the simulations. The average errors between the simulated and predicted peak force and failure displacement were 2.52% and 2.44%, respectively. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

Four tool pin designs are considered for material flow, including one cylindrical pin and three triflute pins with flute radii of 1 mm, 1.5 mm, and 2 mm. The findings indicate that the stir zone is divided into shoulder-driven and pin-driven zones, each exhibiting distinct material flow patterns. In the shoulder-driven zone, material flow toward the advancing side is dominant, while in the pin-driven zone, it flows toward the retreating side. Flutes on the FSW pin tool increase the sweeping rate, strain, and material movement in the stir zone. However, flutes with a larger radius sweep a greater amount of material and thus require more softened material to facilitate movement. Therefore, for defect-free joint formation, a higher rotational speed of the tool will be required, which may adversely affect tool lifespan and joint mechanical properties. The effectiveness of flutes with a smaller radius of 1 mm is significantly greater than that of those with a larger radius (1.5 or 2 mm) in enhancing material flow and achieving defect-free welding. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Aluminum alloys, widely regarded as lightweight structural materials, are extensively used in the aerospace industry. The aging process is essential for reducing residual stresses and ensuring alloys quality. Traditional methods for optimizing aging are often time-consuming and expensive. In contrast, machine learning (ML) accelerates material design and performance prediction, significantly minimizing the need for extensive experimentation. In this study, the 7050 aluminum alloy forgings in aircraft main support joints are selected as the research object. A forward prediction model is developed using common ML algorithms, incorporating two-stage aging process parameters and microstructural features as inputs, with yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) as outputs. The results demonstrate that the extreme gradient boosting regression model is the most effective for predicting the strength of aluminum alloys, with R2 values exceeding 0.7. By the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method and microscopic morphology analysis, the second-stage aging time (t2) significantly influences YS and UTS. Hence, t2 was selected as the output for constructing the reverse classification model. The support vector machine classification model exhibits optimal performance, attaining macro-accuracy and macro-recall rates of 0.91 and 0.90, respectively. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.},

	abstract = {The welding industry is facing increasing demands for improved productivity, efficiency, and quality, particularly in the laser beam welding process. As advanced materials with complex compositions are used to achieve specific functional properties, there is a growing need for a comprehensive and precise understanding of how these materials can be effectively and efficiently joined. In this paper, we present an innovative and comprehensive model that can accurately predict the geometrical, metallurgical, and mechanical characteristics of the laser beam welding process. The model consists of two main subsystems: the thermal dynamic model and the characteristic model. The thermal dynamic model captures essential parameters such as melt pool dimension, maximum temperature, and cooling rates throughout the welding process. This enables the prediction of geometrical characteristics of the weld, particularly in terms of melt pool dimension. The characteristic model encompasses sections dedicated to geometrical, metallurgical, and mechanical characteristics. By analyzing the cooling rate, the model can diagnose important metallurgical characteristics, including primary dendrite arm spacing (PDAS) and secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS). Based on the PDAS and SDAS, the model predicts the mechanical strength during the welding process. The results of our study demonstrate the exceptional accuracy of model 2, which incorporates both primary and secondary dendritic arm distances. The model achieved impressively low error rates of only 0.8298% and 0.8300% for PDAS and SDAS, respectively. These findings highlight the model’s reliability and effectiveness in predicting the mechanical strength of welded joints during the laser beam welding process. This comprehensive model offers valuable insights and predictive capabilities that are crucial for optimizing the welding process and achieving superior productivity, efficiency, and quality. By accurately predicting the geometrical, metallurgical, and mechanical characteristics, it enables engineers and researchers to make informed decisions, enhance process control, and ensure the successful integration of advanced materials in laser beam welding applications. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Additive friction stir deposition is a recent innovation in additive manufacturing allowing the deposition of metallic alloys onto a metallic deposit bed, creating a purely mechanical metallic bond. The deposition can be done in a layer-by-layer manner, and the purely mechanical process eliminates the need for high energy consumption and can be deposited at a much higher rate than beam-based welding. The mechanical nature of the process allows the bonding of dissimilar alloys and a reduction in size of the heat-affected zone. The additive friction stir deposition process is difficult to model and existing literature has focused on numerical analysis, which is not amenable to online closed-loop control. In this work, a form of reservoir computing called an echo state network is used to model the additive friction stir deposition process from online process data, and validation is performed on a reserved dataset. Subsequently, a model-free controller using Lyapunov-derived combination of the robust integral of the sign error, and a single hidden layer neural network design is developed to control the additive friction stir deposition process. Control efficacy is given by way of a Lyapunov analysis which shows the system is globally exponentially stable, and simulation results with the echo state networks. Stability proof shows that under one assumption, the controller can be extrapolated to the real system. The mean squared error of the tracking result using the controller and echo state network simulation is 2.05 ̊C. Copyright VC 2024 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Mechanical properties of Al alloys make them an ideal candidate for different sections of marine, aerospace, automotive, etc. industries. Recently taking the advantages of additive manufacturing (AM), many complex infrastructures/components can be fabricated with very high design freedom via Al alloys. Although Al alloys have good natural corrosion resistance, however improving this property attracts lots of attention in the past few years. Post-processing methods can play a key role for addressing the issues related to internal and surface anomalies associated with as-built AM parts. Generally, these anomalies have detrimental effects on mechanical properties. In the present study, the effect of laser shock peening (LSP) treatment with different laser pulse overlaps and energies was investigated comprehensively on microstructure, surface texture, porosity, hardness, residual stresses as well as corrosion resistance of laser powder bed fused (L-PBF) AlSi10Mg samples. LSP provides strain deformation on the surface, and the deformation enhances by laser beam energy. LSP1 (laser energy of 1.5 J and 50% overlap) and LSP3 (laser energy of 4.5 J and 50% overlap) introduce maximum local strain of 7.5 and 10.7, respectively. The surface roughness of as-built state µm in terms of Rv was effectively diminished to 16.33 after LSP6 (laser energy of 4.5 J and 75% overlap). The results indicated that due to the modified surface texture, improved hardness and induced high compressive residual stresses in the surface layer. (surface hardness improvement and inducing high surface compressive residual stresses were obtained after LSP6 up to 26% and −289 MPa, respectively); the LSP treated samples exhibited higher corrosion resistance with the corrosion rate decreasing down to 50% as compared to the as-built state. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Additive friction stir deposition (AFSD) is a relatively new additive manufacturing technique to fabricate parts in solid state below the melting temperature. Due to the solid-state nature, AFSD benefits from lower residual stresses as well as significantly lower susceptibility to porosity, hot-cracking, and other defects compared to conventional fusion-based metallic additive manufacturing. These unique features make AFSD a promising alternative to conventional forging for fabricating large structures for aerospace, naval, nuclear, and automotive applications. This review comprehensively summarizes the advances in AFSD, as well as the microstructure and properties of the final part. Given the rapidly growing research in AFSD, we focus on fundamental questions and issues, with a particular emphasis on the underlying relationship between AFSD-based processing, microstructure, and mechanical properties. The implications of the experimental and modeling research in AFSD will be discussed in detail. Unlike the columnar structure in fusion-based additive manufacturing, fully dense material with a fine, fully-equiaxed microstructure can be fabricated in AFSD. The as-wrought structure brings the as-printed parts with comparable properties to wrought parts. The fundamental difference between AFSD and fusion-based metallic additive manufacturing will be summarized. Furthermore, the existing challenges and possible future research directions are explored. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {In this paper, the nanosecond pulse laser was used to clean the anodic oxide film on the surface of 5083 aluminum alloy. The effect of different laser travel speeds on the surface roughness and microhardness of cleaned specimens is studied. The effect of different pretreatment methods on welding performance has also been further explored. The results show that the surface roughness of aluminum alloy after laser cleaning shows a trend of first increasing, then decreasing, and then increasing with the increase of laser travel speed. When the laser travels at a speed of 6.5 mm/s, the surface roughness is relatively lowest, about Ra = 0.381 μm. Appropriate laser cleaning parameters can effectively remove the anodic oxide film on the surface of 5083 aluminum alloy. After laser cleaning, the surface microhardness of the specimen has little change with the increase of laser speed, but it shows a trend of first increasing, then decreasing and finally increasing. Compared with untreated and mechanical polishing, the fish scale pattern on the surface of the weld seam cleaned by laser before welding is uniform and consistent, and there are no defects such as pores. Moreover, the tensile performance has also been improved to a certain extent. There are differences in the fracture mechanisms at the fracture surface under different pretreatment methods. The fracture mechanisms at the fracture surface after untreated, mechanical polishing, and laser cleaning treatments are brittle fracture, ductile brittle mixed fracture, and ductile fracture, respectively. © International Institute of Welding 2024.},

	abstract = {This study models the temperature evolution during additive friction stir deposition (AFSD) using machine learning. AFSD is a solid-state additive manufacturing technology that deposits metal using plastic flow without melting. However, the ability to predict its performance using the underlying physics is in the early stage. A physics-informed machine learning approach, AFSD-Nets, is presented here to predict temperature profiles based on the combined effects of heat generation and heat transfer. The proposed AFSD-Nets includes a set of customized neural network approximators, which are used to model the coupled temperature evolution for the tool and build during multi-layer material deposition. Experiments are designed and performed using 7075 aluminum feedstock deposited on a substrate of the same material for 30 layers. A comparison of predictions and measurements shows that the proposed AFSD-Nets approach can accurately describe and predict the temperature evolution during the AFSD process. © 2024 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

	abstract = {In recent years, laser welding has become increasingly popular in the manufacturing industry due to its advantages, including a narrow heat affected zone, low levels of distortion, the possibility of remote processing, and high welding speeds compared to conventional electric arc welding techniques. In the automotive industry, the need for overlapped joint welding, particularly for chassis assembly, has become increasingly relevant. The internal porosity detection and control in laser welding of aluminum alloys has gained significant attention. To support laser users in optimizing the welding process, this paper presents an experimental methodology followed by a phenomenological analysis of the quality of overlapped welded joints. The study focuses on the laser welding of two different aluminum alloy configurations (1.6-mm-thick AA 6061-T6 and 2-mm-thick AA 6061-T6) using three welding strategies (ScanLab remote laser welding system, Trumpf D70 laser head, and Precitec YW52 wobbling head) to evaluate single and multiple laser variants for process parameter tuning. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of X-ray technology as an offline monitoring method for porosity recognition, and analyzes laser beam characterization and beam profile shape to calculate beam distribution. Then, statistical analysis of all methods is conducted and regression analysis is performed. These findings provide valuable insights into the integration of laser welding technology in the automotive and surface transportation industries. The analysis of results indicates that as the spot size decreases, the real spot size changes more abruptly with increasing Z position, whereas with a larger spot size, the beam size remains stable up to +/- 20–30 mm in Z position due to the large lens. Porosity is mainly caused by either a too small spot size (in the absence of wobbling; ≤0.4 mm) or low travel speed (≤4.0–4.5 m/min). On the other hand, if the spot size is too large, hot cracking can occur in autogenous laser welding. © 2023},

	abstract = {Nd: YAG Laser and Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding processes are the most promising joining techniques used for stainless steel (SS) alloys due to their significant weld characteristics. In this study, the effect of two process parameters (weld power and travel speed) on the mechanical properties (ultimate tensile strength and microhardness) of the weldment is investigated. Two different machine learning techniques, namely Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Unified Convolutional Neural Network (UCNN) are also evaluated for prediction of mechanical properties and defect detection through the image processing technique, respectively. A correlation has been performed between these two machine learning approaches with the experimental values. The training data sets are developed for the machine learning techniques, and the obtained results of (ANFIS) and (UCNN) models are related to the actual experimental values. The output of both developed models (ANFIS & UCNN) showed a good agreement with the actual experimental test results. The predicted tensile and microhardness values from the (ANFIS) model were found to greatly agree with the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values from the (UCNN) model. However, owing to the increase in the applications of welding processes in industries, the utilization of machine learning techniques would be more efficient when compared with the other traditional methods that are being adopted. © Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Belgrade.

	abstract = {Nowadays, magnesium alloys are emerging in biomedical implants for their similar properties to natural bones. However, the rapid degradation of magnesium alloys in biological media hinders successful implantation. Refinement of microstructure, as well as reinforcement particles can significantly improve the degradation rate. In this work, multi-pass friction stir processing (FSP) was proposed to synthesize WE43/nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) surface composite, the microstructure, reinforced particle distribution, micro-hardness, corrosion behavior and in-vitro bioactivity were studied. The subsequent FSP passes of WE43 alloy and WE43/nHA composite refined the grain size which was reduced by 94.29% and 95.92% (2.63 and 1.88 µm, respectively) compared to base metal after three passes. This resulted in increasing the microhardness by 120% (90.86 HV0.1) and 135% (105.59 HV0.1) for the WE43 and WE43-nHA, respectively. It is found that increasing FSP passes improved the uniform distribution of nHA particles within the composite matrix which led to improved corrosion resistance and less degradation rate. The corrosion rate of the FSPed WE43/nHA composite after three passes was reduced by 38.2% (4.13 mm/year) and the degradation rate was reduced by 69.7% (2.87 mm/y). This is attributed to secondary phase (Mg24Y5 and Mg41Nd5) particle fragmentation and redistribution, as well as a homogeneous distribution of nHA. Additionally, the growing Ca-P and Mg(OH)2 layer formed on the surface represented a protective layer that reduced the degradation rate. The wettability test revealed a relatively hydrophilic surface with water contact angle of 49.1 ± 2.2° compared to 71.2 ± 2.1° for base metal. Also, biomineralization test showed that apatite layer grew after immersion 7d in simulated body fluid with atomic ratio of Ca/P 1.60 approaching the stoichiometric ratio (1.67) indicating superior bioactivity of FSPed WE43/nHA composite after three passes. These results raise that the grain refinement by FSP and introduction of nHA particles significantly improved the degradation rate and in-vitro bioactivity of WE43 alloy for biomedical applications. © 2023},

The microstructure of Al/steel/steel mixed nugget varies from mixed martensite and ferrite to full martensite as the increasing heat input. The ferrite contains numerous B2 structure nano-precipitates. The introduced Al element by the rivet cavity plays a significant influence on the microstructure, and the competition between ferrite and austenite stabilized elements in mixed nugget is responsible for the microstructure evolution. The phases performance of ferrite and martensite is determined. The average nano-hardness of ferrite is 2.66 GPa (271.3 HV), while that of martensite is 4.68 GPa (477.4 HV), and the yield strength for ferrite and martensite is calculated to be 475.0 MPa and 771.1 MPa, respectively. The average microhardness of the mixed nugget is 369.1 HV, 454.1 HV and 481.7 HV for welding parameters 7 kA-200 m s, 8 kA-200 m s and 9 kA-200 m s, presenting a trend of increasing with the heat input. Considering the multilayer joining containing both the Al/steel heterogeneous and steel/steel homogeneous interfaces, the comprehensive tensile-shear performance is optimal at welding parameters 8 kA-200 m s, 5334 N for Al/steel interface and 19,531 N for steel/steel interface. © 2023 The Authors},

Control of temperature is critical during ShAPE processing to avoid liquefaction, ensure smooth extrusion, and develop desired material properties in the extruded products. Accurate modeling of the complicated thermo-mechanical feedbacks between process inputs, material temperature, and heat generation presents a significant barrier to predictive modeling and process design. In particular, connecting micro-structural scale mechanisms of heat generation to macro-scale predictions of temperature can become computationally intractable. In this work we use a neural network (NN) model of heat generation to bridge this gap, by combining it with a simplified model of the temperature dynamics due to conduction and convection to capture the macro scale evolution of temperature. We inform the construction of the NN heat generation model using crystal plasticity simulations at the micro-structural scale to model the effects of process inputs on generation of heat. We achieved close fits of the temperature dynamics model to a diverse experimental data-set. Further, the relationships learned by the NN model between process inputs and heat generation showed qualitative agreement with those predicted by crystal plasticity simulations. © 2023, Battelle Memorial Institute.},

	abstract = {Mg alloys possess an inherent plastic anisotropy owing to the selective activation of deformation mechanisms depending on the loading condition. This characteristic results in a diverse range of flow curves that vary with a deformation condition. This study proposes a novel approach for accurately predicting an anisotropic deformation behavior of wrought Mg alloys using machine learning (ML) with data augmentation. The developed model combines four key strategies from data science: learning the entire flow curves, generative adversarial networks (GAN), algorithm-driven hyperparameter tuning, and gated recurrent unit (GRU) architecture. The proposed model, namely GAN-aided GRU, was extensively evaluated for various predictive scenarios, such as interpolation, extrapolation, and a limited dataset size. The model exhibited significant predictability and improved generalizability for estimating the anisotropic compressive behavior of ZK60 Mg alloys under 11 annealing conditions and for three loading directions. The GAN-aided GRU results were superior to those of previous ML models and constitutive equations. The superior performance was attributed to hyperparameter optimization, GAN-based data augmentation, and the inherent predictivity of the GRU for extrapolation. As a first attempt to employ ML techniques other than artificial neural networks, this study proposes a novel perspective on predicting the anisotropic deformation behaviors of wrought Mg alloys. © 2024},

	abstract = {Age hardening stands as a crucial strengthening process for aluminium (Al) alloys. However, determining the optimal ageing conditions has traditionally relied on resource-intensive trial-and-error methods. To streamline the design of Al alloys, this study introduces a novel feature screening-assisted machine learning (ML) approach to explore age-hardening behaviour across varying compositions and heat treatment parameters, focusing on yield tensile strength (YTS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and elongation (EL). A comprehensive pool of features, incorporating alloy composition and fundamental elemental properties, was generated to provide metallurgical insights for ML predictions. Subsequently, feature screening methodologies, including correlation analysis, feature elimination, and multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA), were employed to identify key features from the vast feature pool, balancing model complexity and prediction accuracy. Employing support vector regression models trained on these optimized feature sets, we demonstrate enhanced prediction accuracy for strength properties while maintaining model simplicity for EL, with minimal impact on accuracy. In addition, experimental results further validate the method's ability to reproduce ageing curves across all three mechanical properties for both commercialized and newly designed Al alloys. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {The aim of this work is to predict, for the first time, the high temperature flow stress dependency with the grain size and the underlaid deformation mechanism using two machine learning models, random forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN). With that purpose, a ZK30 magnesium alloy was friction stir processed (FSP) using three different severe conditions to obtain fine grain microstructures (with average grain sizes between 2 and 3 µm) prone to extensive superplastic response. The three friction stir processed samples clearly deformed by grain boundary sliding (GBS) deformation mechanism at high temperatures. The maximum elongations to failure, well over 400% at high strain rate of 10−2 s−1, were reached at 400 °C in the material with coarsest grain size of 2.8 µm, and at 300 °C for the finest grain size of 2 µm. Nevertheless, the superplastic response decreased at 350 °C and 400 °C due to thermal instabilities and grain coarsening, which makes it difficult to assess the operative deformation mechanism at such temperatures. This work highlights that the machine learning models considered, especially the ANN model with higher accuracy in predicting flow stress values, allow determining adequately the superplastic creep behavior including other possible grain size scenarios. © 2024},

	abstract = {This study investigates the manufacturing of Aluminum-Alumina composites through Friction Stir Processing (FSP) and explores the resultant enhancements in mechanical properties. A key focus lies on achieving a uniform distribution of Al2O3 particles within the composite matrix, crucial for optimizing material performance. These dispersed particles act as effective strengthening agents, impeding dislocation movement and grain boundary migration, consequently improving mechanical attributes such as hardness, strength, and wear resistance. Experimental findings underscore the efficacy of FSP in enhancing various mechanical properties of the composite. Notably, significant improvements were observed, including a 23.56% increase in tensile strength, a 37.9% enhancement in hardness, a 25.5% improvement in fatigue strength, and a notable 30.12% increase in wear resistance. These results underscore the potential of Aluminum-Alumina composites manufactured via FSP to unlock new opportunities for high-performance materials in industries requiring superior mechanical properties and wear resistance, such as aerospace, automotive, and manufacturing sectors.  © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.},

The variance observed in the process parameter windows per workpiece for defect-free, high-quality joints shows material property dependencies. An in-depth understanding of these dependencies could facilitate process parameter tuning for new welding jobs, especially for workpiece materials/alloys developed through recent techniques like additive manufacturing.

	abstract = {The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in industrial applications, especially solid-state welding (SSW), has transformed modeling, optimization, forecasting, and controlling sophisticated systems. SSW is a better method for joining due to the least melting of material thus maintaining Nugget region integrity. This study investigates thoroughly how AI-based predictions have impacted SSW by looking at methods like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Fuzzy Logic (FL), Machine Learning (ML), Meta-Heuristic Algorithms, and Hybrid Methods (HM) as applied to Friction Stir Welding (FSW), Ultrasonic Welding (UW), and Diffusion Bonding (DB). Studies on Diffusion Bonding reveal that ANN and Generic Algorithms can predict outcomes with an accuracy range of 85 – 99%, while Response Surface Methodology such as Optimization Strategy can achieve up to 95 percent confidence levels in improving bonding strength and optimizing process parameters. Using ANNs for FSW gives an average percentage error of about 95%, but using metaheuristics refined it at an incrementally improved accuracy rate of about 2%. In UW, ANN, Hybrid ANN, and ML models predict output parameters with accuracy levels ranging from 85 to 96%. Integrating AI techniques with optimization algorithms, for instance, GA and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) significantly improves accuracy, enhancing parameter prediction and optimizing UW processes. ANN’s high accuracy of nearly 95% compared to other techniques like FL and ML in predicting welding parameters. HM exhibits superior precision, showcasing their potential to enhance weld quality, minimize trial welds, and reduce costs and time. Various emerging hybrid methods offer better prediction accuracy. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {A series of quinary (Al1/4Ni1/4Zr1/4Co1/4)100-xYx (x = 16–28 at.%) high entropy metallic glass ribbons were successfully fabricated through the high-speed single roller melt-spinning method. The effects of rare-earth element yttrium content on the microstructure and performances of alloy ribbons were systematically investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), heat treatment, transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electrochemical experiments. The microhardness of metallic ribbons was measured by Vickers hardness tester. Results show that the microstructure of the as-quenched alloy ribbons maintain the glassy state and the average microhardness value of each specimen can reach 488 HV0.1 or above. The surface morphologies of the as-spun ribbon samples exhibit the smooth surface with small roughness value of Ra = 0.115–0.150 nm. In the meantime, with the increase of Y content, the glass transition temperature can be detected in the DSC traces when Y content is over 22 at.%, and the crystallization onset temperature shifts to the lower temperature region, suggesting that the thermal stability of amorphous state in Al–Ni–Zr–Co–Y alloy ribbons has been weakened. The (Al1/4Ni1/4Zr1/4Co1/4)84Y16 alloy ribbons own the highest crystallization onset temperature (∼742 K). Adding appropriate yttrium element can enlarge the super-cooled liquid region and improve the glass-forming ability. In 3.5 wt% NaCl solution, the prepared alloy ribbons can maintain smaller corrosion current densities (∼10−8 A cm−2) than traditional Al-based amorphous alloys, 6061 Al alloy and other common structural steels. The X-ray photoelectron spectrometer results indicate that the passive film of equiatomic alloy ribbons is rich in oxides of Al, Zr, Co, and Y elements, which has excellent resistance to chloride ion attack. On the basis of all experimental results, (Al1/4Ni1/4Zr1/4Co1/4)84Y16 alloy ribbons can optimally combine outstanding corrosion resistance, superior thermal stability, and acceptable microhardness. The above research results lay a solid foundation for the composition development of high-performance high entropy metallic glasses. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on identifying the convection heat transfer coefficients of the friction stir welding (FSW) temperature field from the temperature measuring data. Firstly, the numerical model of the FSW temperature field is constructed by utilizing the Lagrangian formulation. Then a novel inversion method combined with the surrogate model is proposed. The surrogate model based on proper orthogonal decomposition and radial basis function (RBF) is applied to approximate the input-output relationship of the numerical model. To improve the calculation efficiency and accuracy of the inversion method, an iterative updating method of the surrogate model combined with parallel computing technology is adopted. Subsequently, the effect of the type of RBF and the measurement position of the thermocouple on the calculation accuracy of the inversion analysis method are analyzed. The conclusions indicate that all the RBFs used in this paper are suitable for constructing the surrogate model of the temperature field. With the thermocouple measuring point close to the weld center, the maximum RMSE calculated by the numerical model decreases from 10.8 °C to 7.0 °C, but the maximum relative error of the peak temperature changes slightly, about 7.5%. The results illustrate that the identified convection heat transfer coefficients allow predictions on the temperature field of FSW which are consistent with the experimental data. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

With the global energy conservation and emission reduction policies, dissimilar aluminium (Al) and copper (Cu) for lithium battery welding are more and more discussed. Laser welding is a unique technology for Al and Cu due to its high energy density, precise control, ease of automation, and remote welding. However, high reflectivity and differences in material properties result in poor laser absorption and an unstable welding process. Furthermore, sufficient mixing of Al and Cu during the welding process tends to form brittle intermetallic compounds (IMCs).

	abstract = {Additive friction stir deposition (AFSD) is a friction stir-based deposition additive manufacturing technology that has garnered significant research attention. This article reviews the research progress of AFSD, covering its process, parameters, characteristics, and applications. AFSD is a thermoplastic machining process that is driven by key process parameters such as tool rotating speed, feed rate, and layer height. The finite element simulation method utilized by AFSD is comparable to that of friction stir welding (FSW). The core process characteristics comprise solid-state deposition and the formation of fine, equiaxed microstructures. Components produced by AFSD exhibit mechanical properties that vary gradually along the build direction. The potential applications of AFSD in additive manufacturing, coating, composite manufacturing, and repair are then presented. Finally, the paper concludes by proposing future directions, including the control of quality, the expansion of applications, and the achievement of automation and intelligence. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {A significant amount of interstitial-free or IF steel is used to manufacture automotive body parts due to its high ductility, high formability, and low yield strength. But, the major drawback of this steel is the lower surface hardness. The current investigation intended to enhance the surface hardness by employing shot peening at different coverages. The work also studied the microstructural features intimated after the treatment and its effect on the surface hardness. The optical and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results showed a prominent grain refinement and dislocation hardening, which improved the micro-hardness to 2.5 times. Tri-junctions, sub-grains, twins, nanocrystalline regions, and several dislocation-induced microstructural features, like dislocation bands, dislocation forests, dislocation walls, dislocation cell structure, etc., were detected in the samples after peening. These features bear a beneficial impact on the surface hardness of the substrate. A spatial filter (Sobel filter) was used to refine the image and detect the presence of NbC precipitates near the grain boundary. Using Gatan DigitalMicrograph software, the thermal imaging technique effectively identified thinner grain boundaries near the segregation zone. © ASM International 2024.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the laser welding process has gained significant popularity and finds extensive applications. For instance, in automobile manufacturing and aerospace industry. Despite its numerous advantages and unique features, the conventional laser welding process has certain limitations and weaknesses. To address these shortcomings, researchers have proposed a new approach known as the “Laser wobble welding process.” Which this method can strongly increase weld ability in challenging material and adapt better weld quality. This study aims to investigate effects of processing parameters of this innovative technique on defect removal and enhancement of weld joint characteristics in practical applications. The laser wobble welding process involves the oscillating movement of the laser beam. Consequently, this phenomenon results in enhanced characteristics of the weld joint. Despite its potential, there exists a research gap in comprehensively investigation the influence of processing parameters in the laser wobble welding process and a continuous summary is not seen. In this study, it strives to provide a comprehensive analysis of the processing parameters involved in the laser wobble welding process. The research focuses on exploring their impact on the weld joint characteristics and current applications. Finally, it is presented the primary application of the laser wobble welding process, particularly in two key areas: 1- Enhancing weldability of challenging materials and 2- Overcoming material incompatibility in non-homogeneous materials through laser welding. This study also investigates and offers valuable insights into the potential of the laser wobble welding process and its implications for improving welding outcomes in challenging aspects. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

The effect of steel fiber (SSF) contents (1%, 2%, 2.5%, and 3%) on the failure process and the relative slip of cracks at different loading stages were measured and evaluated. The results indicate that increasing the SSF content significantly enhances the ultimate shear stress and ductility, effectively limits crack propagation and formation, and reduces the extent of damage for UHPC. During the failure process, an increase in the SSF content results in higher cumulative AE energy and a tendency for the peak frequency to shift towards the low-frequency range. Additionally, increasing the SSF content expands the range of wavelet entropy values and delays the occurrence of wavelet entropy. Due to the reinforcement effects of SSF, the primary crack type evolved from shear to tensile during the failure process. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) processes have proven to be a perfect match for topology optimization (TO), as they are able to realize sophisticated geometries in a unique layer-by-layer manner. From a manufacturing viewpoint, however, there is a significant likelihood of process-related defects within complex geometrical features designed by TO. This is because TO seldomly accounts for process constraints and conditions and is typically perceived as a purely geometrical design tool. On the other hand, advanced AM process simulations have shown their potential as reliable tools capable of predicting various process-related conditions and defects. Thus far, geometry design by topology optimization and multiphysics manufacturing simulations have been viewed as two mostly separate paradigms, whereas one should really conceive them as one holistic computational design tool. More specifically, AM process models provide input to physics-based TO, where consequently, not only the designed component will function optimally, but also will have near-to-minimum manufacturing defects. In this regard, we aim at giving a thorough overview of holistic computational design tool concepts applied within AM. First, literature on TO for performance optimization is reviewed and then the most recent developments within physics-based TO techniques related to AM are covered. Process simulations play a pivotal role in the latter type of TO and serve as additional constraints on top of the primary end-user optimization objectives. As a natural consequence of this, a comprehensive and detailed review of non-metallic and metallic additive manufacturing simulations is performed, where the latter is divided into micro-scale and deposition-scale simulations. Material multi-scaling techniques, which are central to the process-structure-property relationships, are reviewed next, followed by a subsection on process multi-scaling techniques, which are reduced-order versions of advanced process models and are incorporable into physics-based TO due to their lower computational requirements. Finally the paper is concluded and suggestions for further research paths discussed. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Current progress in numerical simulations and machine learning allows one to apply complex loading conditions for the identification of parameters in plasticity models. This possibility expands the spectrum of examined deformed states and makes the identified model more consistent with engineering practice. A combined experimental-numerical approach to identify the model parameters and study the dynamic plasticity of metals is developed and applied to the case of cold-rolled OFHC copper. In the experimental part, profiled projectiles (reduced cylinders or cones in the head part) are proposed for the Taylor impact problem for the first time for material characterization. These projectiles allow us to reach large plastic deformations with true strains up to 1.3 at strain rates up to 105 s−1 at impact velocities below 130 m/s. The experimental results are used for the optimization of parameters of the dislocation plasticity model implemented in 3D with the numerical scheme of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). A Bayesian statistical method in combination with a trained artificial neural network as an SPH emulator is applied to optimize the parameters of the dislocation plasticity model. It is shown that classical Taylor cylinders are not enough for a univocal selection of the model parameters, while the profiled cylinders provide better optimization even if used separately. The combination of different shapes and an increase in the number of experiments increase the quality of optimization. The optimized numerical model is successfully validated by the experimental data about the shock wave profiles in flyer plate experiments from the literature. In total, a cheap, simple, but efficient route for optimizing a dynamic plasticity model is proposed. The dislocation plasticity model is extended to estimate grain refinement and volume fractions of weakened areas in comparison with experimental observations. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The presence of intermetallic compounds (IMCs) can significantly reduce joint mechanical properties, leading to premature failure. In this paper, mechanical manufacture and forming quality analysis of ultrasonically welded (Al/Cu) joints is proposed and investigated by adding different thicknesses interlayers (e.g., Ni, Zn and Mg). The peak load of the joint first increases and then decreases as the Ni interlayer thickness rises. The plastic yield of the 0.10 mm thick Ni interlayer is poor after its failure, leading to an advantageous wavy interface. Three interface bonding modes, e.g., Al- Ni, Cu- Ni and Al-Cu, are better than Zn joints in tensile strength and impact resistance. When the thickness of Ni interlayer is greater than 0.05 mm, the interlayer will not tear during shear tensile. The failure mode of the Cu side is ductile fracture, and the Al side is mixed ductile and brittle fracture. Investigation indicates that the thickness of interlayers significantly affects the formation quality of microstructure. The Ni interlayer with a thickness of 0.1 mm produces the best wavy interface and reduces IMCs under optimized parameters such as P = 0.3 MPa, Amp = 50% and W.E = 2500 J. Ni interlayer promotes the formation of a uniform IMCs layer at the interface between Al and Cu sheets, which contributes to improvements in the mechanical properties of welded joint. In addition, it produces effective deformation in interface microstructure, reducing oxide layers and corrosion effect. © ASM International 2024.},

	abstract = {The construction sector plays an essential role in the global economy, using many exhaustible natural resources, most of which are renewable in low percentages. Moving towards a circular economy is essential because optimizing the consumption of materials and energy contributes to the development of an economic system that is independent, more competitive, and more resilient in the face of economic and social crises and various environmental factors. The current "take, make, and dispose" model of the economy is unsustainable, so a shift in thinking towards a circular economy is necessary. This circular economy is an economic model that minimizes the use of natural resources by selecting them intelligently and minimizing the use of raw materials, favoring the use of recyclable materials wherever possible while managing the resources used and maintaining and reusing them in the economic system for as long as possible. Circular Economy Implementation for Sustainability in the Built Environment emphasizes the need to implement a circular economy model in the built environment and how to create a system that optimizes the use of resources and construction materials while preserving their properties and values. Covering topics such as automobile industries, lean manufacturing, and operation strategy, this premier reference source is an excellent resource for engineers, construction managers, business leaders, urban planners, students and educators of higher education, researchers, and academicians. © 2023 by IGI Global.

	abstract = {TC4 titanium alloy and AA6061 aluminum alloy are widely used in the transportation industry because of their excellent mechanical properties and lightweight. In this work, the TC4 titanium alloy was solution heat treated between 800 °C and 990 °C for 1 h, and water cooled to room temperature. The riveting and tensile tests at room temperature were conducted to evaluate the joint performance. The tensile strength and failure morphology were used to discuss the mechanical performance of joints. Solution heat treatment significantly improves the elongation, mechanical performance, and hardness of TC4 titanium alloy. Compared with the as-received material, the elongation of the treated TC4 titanium alloy is increased by 13% at the solution temperature of 900 °C, the tensile strength was added by 175 MPa at 930 °C, and the hardness was significantly increased. The optimal performance of the TC4 titanium alloy can be obtained at 930 °C. The tensile strength of the joint with the TC4 alloy solution heat treated at 930 °C is the highest of all joints. When the TC4 alloy was solution treated between 800 °C and 850 °C, the rivets were pulled from the AA6061. While at 900 °C and 930 °C, the AA6061 sheet was broken at the rivet. At 960 °C and 990 °C, the TC4 sheet was broken near the rivet. The crack size of TC4 titanium alloy gradually decreases from the rivet outward, and the crack spreads around the rivet. Severe friction can be found, which causes the peeling of the lower plate AA6061 alloy. The breaks of TC4 alloys were the plastic broken. The failure morphology of the TC4 alloy sheet is different under different solution heat treatment temperatures. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {This study presents a methodology that combines artificial multiple intelligence systems (AMISs) and machine learning to forecast the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), maximum hardness (MH), and heat input (HI) of AA-5083 and AA-6061 friction stir welding. The machine learning model integrates two machine learning methods, Gaussian process regression (GPR) and a support vector machine (SVM), into a single model, and then uses the AMIS as the decision fusion strategy to merge SVM and GPR. The generated model was utilized to anticipate three objectives based on seven controlled/input parameters. These parameters were: tool tilt angle, rotating speed, travel speed, shoulder diameter, pin geometry, type of reinforcing particles, and tool pin movement mechanism. The effectiveness of the model was evaluated using a two-experiment framework. In the first experiment, we used two newly produced datasets, (1) the 7PI-V1 dataset and (2) the 7PI-V2 dataset, and compared the results with state-of-the-art approaches. The second experiment used existing datasets from the literature with varying base materials and parameters. The computational results revealed that the proposed method produced more accurate prediction results than the previous methods. For all datasets, the proposed strategy outperformed existing methods and state-of-the-art processes by an average of 1.35% to 6.78%. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This study introduces a novel deep learning network that integrates a single-layer bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network with a coding layer to analyze the hot deformation behavior of various alloys. The single-layer Bi-LSTM model adeptly predicts experimental stress-strain curves obtained under different deformation temperatures and strain rates, demonstrating superior effectiveness and excellent performance in modeling hot deformation behaviors of the FGH98 nickel-based alloy and TiAl intermetallic alloy. The present model achieves the coefficient of determination of 0.9051 for FGH98 and 0.9307 for TiAl alloys, whereas the corresponding values of 0.8105 and 0.8356 are obtained by the conventional strain-compensated Sellars constitutive equation (SCS model). Additionally, the mean absolute percentage error of the single-layer Bi-LSTM model are 11.37% for FGH98 and 7.16% for TiAl alloys, while the SCS model gains the corresponding error of 15.29% and 17.01%. These results show that the present model has enhances the predictive accuracy exceeding 10% for both FGH98 and TiAl alloys over the SCS model. Consequently, the proposed single-layer Bi-LSTM model provides substantial potential for optimizing manufacturing processes and improving material properties. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {In this study, friction stir processing (FSP) is proposed for the treatment of AZ61 alloy, and an artificial neural network is built to predict and compare the experimental wear results. The effects of different processing parameters, including spindle speed (800-1200 rpm), traveling speed (5-15 mm min−1), and depth of press (0.8-1.2 mm) on the microstructural evolution, mechanical properties, and wear behavior are investigated. Microstructural analysis reveals a grain size of 14 ± 2 μm for the FSP1 sample, with observed shifting of x-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks, indicative of texture development. Increasing spindle and traveling speeds increase the surface roughness, as observed by average roughness (Ra) values of 68.4 nm for a rotational speed of 800 rpm, traveling speed of 5 mm min−1, and shoulder depth of 0.8 mm (FSP1) and 116.3 nm for rotational speed of 1200 rpm, traveling speed of 15 mm min−1, and shoulder depth of 1 mm (FSP9). Microhardness values increase to 113.36 Hv for FSP1 and 79. 51 Hv for FSP9 compared to 65.92 Hv for the base material (BM) sample. The decrement in hardness from FSP1 to FSP9 can be attributed to increased heat input, resulting in coarse microstructure. Wear results show that FSP1 exhibits the lowest weight loss (0.003 g) and coefficient of friction (COF) (0.28) compared to other FSP conditions and BM samples (weight loss of 0.022 g and COF of 0.68). This work demonstrates the efficacy of friction stir processing in enhancing the wear resistance of magnesium alloys. © 2024 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is a popular additive manufacturing technique, but attaining optimal processing variables continues to be a significant challenge. The design of experiments (DOE) method is used in this work to explore the effect of processing factors on the mechanical characteristics of metal-polymer composites generated by FDM, with a particular focus on adhesion. Filling quantity, extruded temperatures, raster orientation, and film thickness are considered fundamental design factors in the study, which employs Taguchi optimization methodology and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to investigate the relationship between processing variables, and tensile characteristics, such as ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, Young’s modulus, ductility, and elongation at fracture. Tensile strength improved by 57% and yield strength increased by 85% when 20% aluminium was added to polylactic acid (PLA). It was also discovered that the ductility decreased with each incremental addition of aluminium to PLA. The tension investigation tests were carried out in line with ASTM D638-10. The results suggest that optimizing processing factors, such as 100% filling amount, 220 °C extruded temperature, 90° raster orientation, and 0.1 mm film thickness may greatly improve adhesion in FDM-fabricated metal-polymer composites. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The present chapter provides an overview of advanced welding techniques, highlighting the current trends and future perspectives in the field. The chapter explores various advanced welding methods, including beam welding (LBW, LAHW, EBW), arc welding (PAW, CMTW, X-TIGW, X-MIGW), friction welding (LFW, OFW, FSW, FSSW, FSAM), pulse welding (USW, MPW), under welding (X-UWW, UVW, UPW), material-specific welding (NW, DMW, GW), smart welding (SW, AW), hybrid welding (X-HW), and so on. The chapter covers current advances in advanced welding processes, with an emphasis on advanced welding techniques beyond traditional methods to include innovative approaches, tools, and equipment to meet the challenges of complex projects and demanding applications. These techniques aim to increase productivity, reduce costs, increase weld integrity, and provide greater control over the welding process. This chapter investigates the use of sophisticated welding techniques in metal deposition, particularly emphasizing the regulated metal deposition (RMD) process over axial spray transfer. Because of its capacity to solve the obstacles associated with traditional welding procedures, the RMD process, a version of gas metal arc welding (GMAW), is gaining favor. The chapter focuses on axial spray transfer, an advanced welding process. It presents the developments in spray transfer by outlining the basic concepts underpinning axial spray transfer, such as the importance of gas shielding, wire feed, and electrical factors in the operation. The axial spray transfer equipment requirements, such as power supplies, torches, and wire feeders, and instances of successful axial spray transfer deployment in diverse sectors are discussed. The chapter includes surface tension transfer as a highly regulated form of GMAW that uses a controlled short circuit and low heat input. Friction welding (FW) is a solid-state welding process that produces welds with good mechanical properties. Friction stir spot welding (FSSW) is a subtype of FSW used to join overlapping materials without cutting through the entire thickness. Impulse welding generates heat and welds materials using high-frequency ultrasonic vibration (USW) or magnetic pulses (MPW). Pulse welding is fast, clean, and can be automated. Submerged welding processes mainly include underwater (UWW), under vacuum (UVW), under magnetic field (UMFW), and under powder (UPW) welding. Submerged welding is mostly used for surface modification to improve the wear resistance of the workpiece. Nanopowders or metal matrix composite (MMC) powders are used to increase the hardness and wear resistance of the surface layers. Green welding processes aim to reduce energy consumption and emissions and optimize material utilization. Nano-welding (NW) is a type of welding that occurs at the nanoscale and involves manipulating and joining nanostructures and nanomaterials. Smart welding (SW) is focusing more on automated welding (AUW) through the use of automation and robotics. Augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), sophisticated sensor and monitoring systems, green welding, and other concepts will continue to play an important role in technology-assisted welding. Additive manufacturing (AM) is being explored as a welding process for fabricating complicated geometries and multi-material structures. Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is an important process for additive manufacturing of metals. HW can use a combination of all available welding techniques to achieve better advancement and customization. The chapter finishes with an overview of the important discoveries and future possibilities in advanced welding. The presence of welding is promising as continued advances in power sources, filler metals, shielding gases, and joint design will make welding faster, stronger, more flexible, and more adaptable than ever before. As welding becomes a ubiquitous and important industrial activity, the possibilities are limitless in the future. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Himanshu Vashishtha, Deepak Kumar and Ravindra V.

	abstract = {Additive friction stir deposition is an emerging solid-state metal additive manufacturing technology that can conveniently and economically produce fully-dense, high-end components, rendering it promising for high-value manufacturing industries, such as defense, aerospace, and space. Like in other metal additive processes, the thermal characteristics in additive friction stir deposition govern the quality and properties of the printed products but is challenging to predict and control in this complex manufacturing system. Recent advances in artificial intelligence provide a powerful data-driven prediction paradigm, which nevertheless necessitates extensive training datasets and struggles to be applied across diverse material systems that exhibit significant variations in thermal and material flow characteristics during printing. Relying solely on physics-based modeling also lacks success due to potential model discrepancies, unknown material parameters, and high computational cost. Here, we propose to address these challenges by developing an explainable artificial intelligence scheme via Bayesian learning, in which the physics-based surrogate model is calibrated and updated via machine learning of in-situ monitoring data, resulting in a physics-informed, data-driven model for temperature distribution during additive friction stir deposition. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated in printing of an Al-Mg-Si alloy, in which fast, accurate temperature prediction is achieved using a moderate number of physics simulation trials and a small number of in-situ measurements. This approach also offers physical insights into previously unknown parameters, such as the interfacial slip/stick coefficient and back heat transfer constant. © 2023 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers},

	abstract = {In this study, the response of welding force characteristic to weld-forming process in friction stir welding (FSW) was systematically investigated. Assisted by machine learning technique, we found that both the force value and some detailed characteristics of force waveform are very important in reflecting the characteristics of weld formation. The mapping relations between force characteristics and weld/defect characteristics were comprehensively summarized for the first time. The results show that the distortion of the force waveform signifies the formation of defect, and the distortion degree and deflection direction of the force waveform show high relevancy to the size and location of defect. Meanwhile, the force waveform is decomposed into three standard sinusoidal waves with different frequencies, and the three sinusoidal waves correspond to the formation of the periodic weld microstructures in nugget zone. The causes of force fluctuations, with associated material deformation and flow behaviors during the FSW process, were also clarified to explain the above correspondences. The main reason is that force characteristics are closely related to the tool motion, probe geometric profile and welding parameter, which are key in heat generation and control the material flow in FSW. Therefore, it is concluded that the welding force characteristic is powerful in revealing some key information of the complicated weld-forming process, which can help us to make a deep understanding of FSW and develop intelligent FSW technologies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to discuss the state-of-the-art digital factory (DF) development combining digital twins (DTs), sensing devices, laser additive manufacturing (LAM) and subtractive manufacturing (SM) processes. The current shortcomings and outlook of the DF also have been highlighted. A DF is a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility that uses innovative technologies, including automation, artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things, additive manufacturing (AM), SM, hybrid manufacturing (HM), sensors for real-time feedback and control, and a DT, to streamline and improve manufacturing operations. Design/methodology/approach: This study presents a novel perspective on DF development using laser-based AM, SM, sensors and DTs. Recent developments in laser-based AM, SM, sensors and DTs have been compiled. This study has been developed using systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, discussing literature on the DTs for laser-based AM, particularly laser powder bed fusion and direct energy deposition, in-situ monitoring and control equipment, SM and HM. The principal goal of this study is to highlight the aspects of DF and its development using existing techniques. Findings: A comprehensive literature review finds a substantial lack of complete techniques that incorporate cyber-physical systems, advanced data analytics, AI, standardized interoperability, human–machine cooperation and scalable adaptability. The suggested DF effectively fills this void by integrating cyber-physical system components, including DT, AM, SM and sensors into the manufacturing process. Using sophisticated data analytics and AI algorithms, the DF facilitates real-time data analysis, predictive maintenance, quality control and optimal resource allocation. In addition, the suggested DF ensures interoperability between diverse devices and systems by emphasizing standardized communication protocols and interfaces. The modular and adaptable architecture of the DF enables scalability and adaptation, allowing for rapid reaction to market conditions. Originality/value: Based on the need of DF, this review presents a comprehensive approach to DF development using DTs, sensing devices, LAM and SM processes and provides current progress in this domain. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In this study, we propose a monitoring methodology that can predict misalignment between electrodes and a rivet in the REW of a three-sheet stack-up, where visual inspection technologies are not available for measuring the misalignment between electrodes and a rivet element. To that end, the effects of the misalignment between electrodes and a rivet on REW joint quality (tensile shear strength, nugget diameter) were investigated using a three-sheet stack-up of SPFC590 sheet (top sheet), Al6061 sheet (middle sheet) with a rivet inserted, and SABC1470 sheet (bottom sheet). A pre-contact process designed to predict the misalignment was added before the REW process. The characteristic of dynamic resistance and welding power according to the misalignment distance was analyzed, and features of dynamic resistance waveform in the pre-contact process were extracted to be used as input to a deep neural network (DNN) model that can predict the misalignment between electrodes and a rivet. A DNN model predicting the state of the misalignment between electrodes and a rivet was designed and trained, and the misalignment was predicted with 100% accuracy from the DNN model. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

The built models successfully classified welds between sound and defective with accuracies over 95%, proving their usefulness in identifying defects on new datasets.

	abstract = {With remarkable learning capabilities and swift operational speeds, artificial intelligence (AI) can assist researchers in swiftly extracting valuable patterns, trends, and associations from subjective information. Tribological behaviors are characterized by dependence on systems, evolution with time, and multidisciplinary coupling. The friction process involves a variety of phenomena, including mechanics, thermology, electricity, optics, magnetics, and so on. Hence, tribological information possesses the distinct characteristics of being multidisciplinary, multilevel, and multiscale, so that the application of AI in tribology is highly extensive. To delineate the scope, classification, and recent trends of AI implementation in tribology, this review embarks on exploration of the tribology research domain. It comprehensively outlines the utilization of AI in basic theory of tribology, intelligent tribology, component tribology, extreme tribology, bio-tribology, green tribology, and other fields. Finally, considering the emergence of “tribo-informatics” as a novel interdisciplinary field, which combines tribology with informatics, this review elucidates the future directions and research framework of “AI for tribology”. In this paper, tribo-system information is divided into 5 categories: input information (I), system intrinsic information (S), output information (O), tribological state information (Ts), and derived state information (Ds). Then, a fusion method among 5 types of tribo-system information and different AI technologies (regression, classification, clustering, and dimension reduction) has been proposed, which enables tribo-informatics methods to solve common problems such as tribological behavior state monitoring, behavior prediction, and system optimization. The purpose of this review is to offer a systematic comprehension of tribo-informatics and to inspire new research ideas of tribo-informatics. Ultimately, it aspires to enhance the efficiency of problem-solving in tribology. (Figure presented.). © The author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {The review paper delivers information related to joining highly differential thermomechanical properties of dissimilar metals with different welding methods from conventional to un-conventional approaches. This paper systematically arranges the issues arises and their solution methods in dissimilar joining using simple, fast and cost-effective arc welding over non-conventional approaches. It addresses key issues such as the formation of intermetallic compounds (IMCs), residual stress, solidification cracking, grain fineness, crystal formation and weld inhomogeneity, which are prevalent in transition joints used in many applications such as the nuclear power plant, chemical, aircraft, transportation, power generating sectors. This review highlights the use of low heat input and magnetic arc stirrers in Al-Cu joints to reduce the thickness of IMC layers, and enhance joint quality. In the case of SS-Cu welding, high energy density processes are recommended to accommodate the differing thermal properties, utilizing high welding speeds and beam tilting techniques. It emphasizes the significant role of external factors such as preheat temperature, filler material, arc force, beam/arc offset, beam/arc oscillation on grain refinement, weldment mixing, crystal formation, stress reduction, solidification cracking prevention and metallurgical modifications to improve weld quality. Additionally, the review explores a comprehensive analysis of Finite Element Model (FEM) validated by experimental data, to accurately capture complex welding phenomena, such as weld bead morphology, residual stress distribution, phase changes, molten metal flow behavior, heat distribution, and microstructural evolution. Finally, this review paper aims to bridge existing research gaps by presenting both low and high energy welding techniques and offers insights into optimizing welding parameters to improve the mechanical and metallurgical properties of dissimilar metal joints. © ASM International 2024.},

It employs a thin, electrically charged wire to erode the material, creating complex shapes with high accuracy, tight tolerance, and minimal material waste. The current study investigates the effect of WEDM process parameters on the various output properties of machining a hybrid Aluminium metal matrix nanocomposite (HAMMNC). A series of experiments were conducted on a composite constructed using Taguchi’s standard L18 Orthogonal Array (OA) design. The acquired responses of Material-Removal-Rate (MRR), Surface-Roughness (SR), and Kerf-Width (KfW) were optimized using integrated Entropy-COPRAS and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms respectively. The relative significance ( Q i )values obtained for the alternatives are analyzed with the Taguchi method. The outcomes showed that the optimal setting of WEDM process variables is achieved at Servo Voltage: high volts; Pulse-on-time: 60 μs; Pulse-off-time: 16 μs; Peak Current: 6 Amp; Variable frequency: 18 Hz; Speed: 50 RPM; Sim Speed: 30 RPM respectively.

	abstract = {This research presents a comprehensive study on the fabrication of metal matrix composites (MMCs) through the friction stir consolidation (FSC) process. The investigation integrates Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation, optimization using Response Surface Methodology (RSM), artificial neural network (ANN) model validation, Genetic Algorithm (GA), and experimental validation. The primary goal is to achieve minimal porosity in the fabricated MMCs. The DEM simulation provides insight into the FSC process, offering a virtual platform to analyze material behavior and optimize process parameters. RSM and GA are employed to optimize key parameters, including rotation speed, applied load, composite thickness, consolidation time, and composition of the metal matrix. RSM predicts an optimal configuration at 800 rpm rotation speed, 500 N applied load, 12 mm composite thickness, 6 min of consolidation time, and a 5% composition of the metal matrix. This combination is projected to yield a minimum porosity response of 0.62%. In contrast, GA suggests an optimal configuration with identical rotation speed, applied load, thickness, and consolidation time, but a higher 15% composition of the metal matrix. This prediction gives a lower minimum porosity response of 0.47%. Experimental validation of the predicted optima is carried out, revealing promising results. Both RSM and GA accurately predicted the optimal configurations for achieving minimal porosity in the fabricated MMCs through the FSC process. In conclusion, this research successfully integrates DEM simulation, RSM, GA, ANN model validation, and experimental validation to optimize the fabrication of MMCs via the FSC process. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this research is to assess the influence of adding copper with varying mesh sizes on spot welding through the use of tensile strength, microphotographs, and hardness measurements. We'll use type 1100 aluminum material with a variety of mesh sizes in this experiment, including 40, 50, and 60. Tensile strength testing (by ASME QW-462.9), microphotography with a metallographic microscope, and the Vickers test were also done (AWS D8 standard.9-97). Tensile test values were determined at meshes 40 (556.38), 50 (739.13), and 60 (1316.10), with the fusion zone (nugget) area exhibiting the highest hardness value. The heat-affected zone area comes next, followed by the base metal area, with a mesh size of 60.50 and 40 in order of hardness. The micro-image test produces identical results because they both use the same substance. © 2024 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The manufacturing industry constantly aims to improve product quality while improving production speed and lowering production costs. Resistance spot welding (RSW) is widely used in the automotive industry to join thin sheets of coated and uncoated materials. Manufacturers measure weld quality by performing destructive tests like peel and with the help of metallographic examination, which is time-consuming. Further, critical welding parameters need to be optimized to achieve consistent and predictable weld quality. This work addresses the effects of the three critical welding parameters: welding current, welding time, and electrode force on RSW of 1.40-mm-thick DP780 steel sheets. The weld quality indicators studied are nugget diameter (from the peel test), peel strength, tensile shear strength, and the mean dynamic contact resistance. Artificial neural network and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system models were used to predict the weld quality indexes, and the prediction accuracy was found to be 99.36 and 99.98%, respectively. A mathematical model was developed using regression analysis to correlate the welding parameters and weld quality indicators. The multi-objective optimization of the welding parameters was done using the genetic algorithm, and its results were validated experimentally. It was found that the welding current had the most significant impact on the weld quality, followed by the electrode force and the welding time. © ASM International 2023.},

	abstract = {Simple shear presents a local material structure–property relationship and plays an important role in the development of material design, mechanical modeling, and manufacturing processes for sheet metals. Simple shear tests are extensively adopted to reveal the stress-state-dependent mechanisms of material microstructure evolution with their corresponding mechanical properties, to develop sophisticated constitutive models capturing complex mechanical behaviors, and to precisely characterize the failure limits for shear-dominated or large-strain deformation processes. Thus, the simple shear methodology including specimen geometry, fixing and loading device, data acquisition and the set of procedures for results analysis, has become a topic of growing interest because of its various distinctive capacities. Over the years, several simple shear analyses and test methods have been proposed without a unified understanding. Interpreting the experimental results can be confusing due to the complexity of finite deformation, variety of boundary conditions in practice, and complexity of the mechanical behavior of materials; however, neither a widely accepted protocol nor a systematic overview of this topic exists. To fill this gap, the present study attempts to provide a comprehensive review of the simple shear methodology for sheet metals, which will serve as a reference for summarizing substantial efforts to improve the understanding and gain valuable scientific insight, a guideline to discover local structure–property relationships of materials, and a solid step for shedding light on its standardization. In this paper, the motivation for the development of a simple shear methodology is first discussed, and the recent progress in experimental mechanics and experimental technologies is summarized. Its application in understanding the mechanical behaviors (hardening, yielding, and ductile fracture) is focused on, and the structure–property relationships revealed by simple shear are further highlighted. The challenges and prospects for future research are discussed. The principles, methodologies, and perspectives provided are highly relevant and are expected to benefit emerging areas such as heterostructured materials, micro/nanoscale mechanical testing, nonlocal plasticity, and additive manufacturing (AM). © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Friction Stir Welding (FSW) has revolutionized modern manufacturing with its advantages, such as minimal heat-affected zones and improved material properties. Accurate torque prediction in FSW is crucial for weld quality, process efficiency, and energy conservation. Many researchers achieved models for torque based on experimental research, yet the models were limited to a specific type of material. In recent years, the use of machine learning techniques has increased in industry in general and in welding in particular. In this study, a machine learning model was prepared based on artificial neural networks, and Shapley-Additive Explanations were used to predict the rotational torque from 287 experiments that had been conducted in several previous studies. The achieved model has remarkable predictive performance, with an R-squared of 99.53% and low errors (MAE, MAPE, and RMSE). Moreover, a machine learning polynomial regression was examined for comparisons. A parametric importance analysis revealed that rotational speed, plate thickness, and tilt angle significantly affect torque predictions, while the rest of the variables had minimal importance. © 2024 University of Tehran.

	abstract = {The industry sector has long been seeking methods to enhance its manufacturing system control, production, and monitoring, while maintaining the quality of its products and reducing costs and time. One method for achieving a more comprehensive understanding of the manufacturing processes is the identification of a corresponding process window (PW). However, there is no globally accepted definition of process window, which is principally used in different manufacturing processes. In some cases, it is combined with operating window or process map concepts. In light of the aforementioned consideration, this article puts forth a definition of process window, drawing upon the various notions and aspects related to the optimal process parameters selection as discussed in the literature. Furthermore, the identification of key controllable process parameters and the criteria to delimit boundaries of desired parts are described as aspects to identify the corresponding process window. Moreover, this paper provides an overview of the techniques used to establish a process window, principally through the application of machine learning techniques (ML) and design of experiments (DOE). Furthermore, the uncertainty intrinsic to the manufacturing process and the methodologies employed to identify the process window are examined. In conclusion, this article emphasises the necessity of transferring these models to new materials or machines, which will require further investigation in future research. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {As one of the important development directions in modern railway and automobile, lightweight requires reliable connection technology of dissimilar materials. Thermal-assisted friction stir lap welding (TA-FSLW) is an available welding technology for the joining of dissimilar materials, which can solve the problems of physical and chemical properties in the welding process of dissimilar materials. Unfortunately, defects may occur during the welding process. This paper proposes a defect diagnosis method based on smooth pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (SPWVD) and ResNet18 for Al-CFRTP TA-FSLW. Firstly, the acoustic emission (AE) signal and the temperature of the weld nugget are acquired by the AE sensor and thermography camera in the FSLW process. Then, the time–frequency domain features of AE signal are extracted by SPWVD, and the maximum temperature of the weld nugget is extracted by exponential moving average (EMA) from thermography. Moreover, the dataset is established by SPWVD features, maximum temperature of welding nugget, and several time–frequency features. Finally, the ResNet18-attention network is employed to classify welding defects and stages. The Al-CFRTP TA-FSLW experiments are carried out based on the proposed method. Experimental result indicates that the SPWVD spectrum can effectively extract the feature frequency of deep and shallow hole defects in the welding process. In the section of classification, the accuracy of the dataset with SPWVD features is improved by 2% to 4% compared to other methods, which demonstrates that the SPWVD feature is superior in defect feature extraction. © 2024},

With the rapid development of the WRIA area, it is both urgent and challenging to comprehensively review the relevant studies. Therefore, this paper provides an extensive review of 164 papers published in the recent quarter century (1997–2021) ever since its first coined. Three key aspects, namely the challenges faced by WRIA, the evolutionary paths involved in the technology, and the specific application tasks are further discussed in detail.

A design of experiment (DoE) approach is used to conduct experiments on FSP and to evaluate the best operating parameters of FSP. ANN uses 30 neurons, 1 hidden layer, and an input and output layer in the Matlab® environment. ANN predicts the output parameters with R values of 0.999, 0.995, and 0.992 for training, validation, and test datasets, respectively, while the overall R-value is 0.997. GRA is used to optimize and rank the parameters of the processes and revealed that the rotational tool speed should be 1180 rpm, traverse feed rate 38 mm/min, and tool tilt angle 1° for best results. The optimized values obtained are 380 MPa, 3.8 µm, 138 HV, and 14% for tensile strength, grain size, microhardness, and elongation, respectively. According to the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and grey relational analysis, the order of influencing parameters on output factors was rotational speed (80%), followed by transverse feed (19%) and tool tilt angle (1%). An ANN is further used to predict using the two most significant parameters—rotational speed and traverse feed. The modified ANN has nearly the same R values as the original ANN.

	abstract = {The instrumented indentation technique has been investigated to efficiently evaluate the mechanical responses of materials with few limitations on the shape and size of the specimen. There have been attempts to discover a direct correlation between the stress-strain curve and the indenting load-displacement curve by introducing the concept of representative strain and stress. However, it is still difficult to find relible parameters and to distinguish similar load-displacement curves that correspond to different stress-strain curves with a limited number of experimental datasets. The present study introduces a finite element method (FEM)-based simulation that can output various load-displacement datasets corresponding to intrinsic properties of materials, including strain rate; these datasets are validated using experimental indentation results for diverse metallic materials at different indenting speeds (0.6, 0.9, 1.2 mm/min). In addition, an autoencoder (AE)-shaped artificial neural network (ANN) model is designed to efficiently characterize those datasets. Then, the indenting load-displacement datasets are extracted into effective physically meaningful datasets by introducing a data post-processing procedure. The proposed indentation FEM-AE-shaped ANN model demonstrates that a long-range true stress-strain curve can be attained even from a noisy experimental load-displacement dataset. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {A flexible data-driven methodology was developed to forecast the mechanical behavior of an aluminum alloy, namely Al6061-T6, in the case of friction stir welding. Specifically, Gated recurrent unit (GRU), a deep learning model, was investigated in this study. This is the first time the GRU model has been used to forecast the stress-strain curve of a material. The major features of the GRU consist in its ability to model time-series data and rely only on historical and actual data from the investigated material. The performance of the GRU model has been demonstrated based on actual data collected by conducting uniaxial tensile testing on the base material, and friction stirred welded, both tested at a deformation speed of 10-3s-1. Forecasting tensile tests results showed promising and accurate results of the GRU-driven forecasting. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Owing to melting and solidification, serious issues arise in fusion-based metal additive manufacturing, such as solidification porosity, columnar grains, and large grain sizes. Recently, additive friction stir deposition has been demonstrated to overcome these issues via high-temperature, rapid plastic deformation, which can result in fully-dense as-printed material with equiaxed, fine grains. However, the deformation fundamentals underlying this process—e.g., the strain magnitude, its influence on dynamic microstructure evolution, and material flow details—remain poorly understood. Here, we explore the deformation fundamentals of additive friction stir deposition by employing tracer-based feed material (Al-Cu tracer embedded in Al-Mg-Si matrix). This allows us to unravel: (i) the path of plastic deformation, and (ii) concurrent grain structure evolution along the deformation path. X-ray computed tomography is used to directly observe the plastic deformation paths of center and edge tracers. In both cases, the millimeter-scale cylindrical tracer undergoes extrusion- and torsion-like deformation followed by shear-induced thinning, which eventually results in micro-ribbons piling up along the deposition track. Microstructure mapping along the deformation path reveals significant grain refinement during initial material feeding via geometric dynamic recrystallization but no further grain refinement during steady-state deposition. By analyzing the strain components associated with extrusion, torsion, and shear-induced thinning, we estimate the total strain to be on the order of 101 and establish a quantitative relationship between the strain and tracer grain size. While this work focuses on a specific process, the methodology and findings may provide the basis for developing future deformation processing-based additive technologies. © 2021},

	abstract = {Friction stir welding (FSW) is a solid-state technique used to join Al-Zn-Mg alloys effectively compared with other conventional welding methods. Al-Zn-Mg alloy was processed for welding because they significantly demanded various engineering applications. A novel method of this research work is to characterize the unique mechanical properties of Al-Zn-Mg alloy reinforced with 1 to 3 wt% of nano silicon carbide (nano-SiC) particles developed by novel interlock friction-stir welding. The process parameters chosen for welding are rotational tool speed 1100 rpm, weld speed 25 mm/min, and triangular pin profile. The weld joint properties such as tensile strength, yield strength, and hardness were tested per ASTM standard. The microstructure of weld joints was studied with XRD and optical and scanning electron microscopy. The existence of silica particles in the weld joints and uniformed and homogeneous distribution of the particulates in the weld was verified by EDS analysis and microstructure. Al-Zn-Mg reinforced with nano-SiC joints has better static properties due to intensive softening in the stir region. Al-Zn-Mg with 3 wt% nano-SiC exhibits maximum tensile strength, yield strength, and nugget hardness of 191 MPa, 165 MPa, and 171 HV. Weld microstructures showed a pinning mechanism because nano-SiC particles were used as reinforcement during friction stir welding. © 2021 L. Natrayan et al.},

	abstract = {Friction stir welding is a method used to weld together materials considered challenging by fusion welding. FSW is primarily a solid phase method that has been proven efficient due to its ability to manufacture low-cost, low-distortion welds. The quality of weld and stresses can be determined by calculating the amount of heat transferred. Recently, many researchers have developed algorithms to optimize manufacturing techniques. These machine learning techniques have been applied to FSW, which allows it to predict the defect before its occurrence. ML methods such as the adaptive neurofuzzy interference system, regression model, support vector machine, and artificial neural networks were studied to predict the error percentage for the friction stir welding technique. This article examines machine learning applications in FSW by utilizing an artificial neural network (ANN) to control fracture failure and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect faults. The ultimate tensile strength is predicted using a regression and classification model, a decision tree model, a support vector machine for defecting classification, and Gaussian process regression (UTS). Machine learning implementation mainly promotes uniformity in the process and precision and maximally averts human error and involvement.  © 2022 Utkarsh Chadha et al.},

	abstract = {Bulk hot deformation is a relatively old manufacturing technique widely adopted in different industry fields to form and shape different metallic alloys. Martensitic stainless steels (MSS) are a class of metals used in industries with extreme conditions. Hot forming of this class of steels is a highly complex process comprising several highly coupled thermo-chemo-physical phenomena. The complex microstructural changes of MSS make it challenging to develop an overall system of governing equations for theoretically analyzing the behavior of MSS during the hot deformation process. Modeling and simulation analysis have frequently been used to minimize the number of experiments often used to find MSS behavior during hot deformations. This review paper deals with the latest developments in the numerical analysis of material behavior, microstructural simulation, and artificial intelligence methods for MSS during the hot deformation process. Important numerical issues in macro and micro-scale models, such as various materials flow modeling, finite element methods, cellular automaton, and artificial neural networks, are discussed. Macro-scale analysis of hot deformation will allow many manufacturing processes to understand the effects of changes in different strain and strain rates before physical testing. Micro-scale analysis of hot deformation will allow understanding physical phenomena concerning dynamic recrystallization, plastic deformation energy, and microstructure size. The main methods used in the MSS hot deformation process simulation are discussed and illustrated with brief case studies. In addition, several critical vital problems and issues remain to be addressed about this topic, and opportunities for further research are identified.  © 2022 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The gearbox shell is a key component of class A of high-speed trains. In engineering applications, the fatigue life prediction of the gearbox shell is a critical issue to be addressed. It is not feasible to obtain fatigue life results for the gearbox shell experimentally because of its long design life, lack of actual failure data, complex structure, high test cost, and material dispersion. Therefore, the cross-scale method was introduced to accurately predict the fatigue life of the gearbox shell. In this study, the entire gearbox shell is divided into two scales of "material structure."Firstly, the S-N curve is plotted within the material layer, based on the data from the rotating bending fatigue test. Secondly, the finite element model of the gearbox shell is established within the structural layer via the simulation platform. The characteristics and random vibration of the established model are analyzed and presented. Additionally, the first ten-order frequency of modal analysis and power spectral density responses of the gearbox are obtained. The fatigue life of the gearbox shell and the safe running distance of the train are calculated by using the three-interval method and the linear cumulative damage rule, respectively, by combining the fatigue analysis from the material layer with the simulation analysis from the structure layer. Finally, to illustrate the application of the proposed method, a group of small-scale test examples is provided. The proposed method can be used in fatigue life prediction more effectively than the single finite element simulation method. © 2022 Yibo Ai et al.},

	abstract = {Differently from the powder-based additive (AM) techniques, wire-based ones aim to produce larger parts with moderate complexity and semi-finished features. For this reason, wire-based additive manufacturing (WBAM) is a strong candidate to compete with subtractive manufacturing techniques and forging. Compared to powder-based, WBAM presents higher layer thickness, thus having higher build-up and deposition rates, despite lower-dimensional accuracies and surface roughness. However, WBAM and powder-based AM are not concurrent technologies since both produce parts for different applications. Problems in EBAM are amplified due to the large part sizes; residual stresses and distortion from the high heat input directly impair the part quality. Furthermore, the thermal history resulting from the repetitive layering is responsible for generating complex metallurgical phenomena, requiring investigations to select the best combination of process parameters and deposition strategy for each material. Nonetheless, since WBAM processes use the same principles of welding with filler material (or, in the case of AM, feedstock), advances are taking place faster. Accordingly, WBAM techniques such as wire and arc AM (WAAM), wire-based electron beam AM (w-EBAM or EBAM), and wire and laser additive manufacturing (WLAM) have achieved maturity, proving their feasibility in producing parts for critical structural applications in fields such as aerospace. This chapter is destined to expose recent research conducted on the WBAM of Ti and NiTi alloys, compare different WBAM techniques, introduce the use of cored wires for AM, present new AM processes, and give a brief and concise overview of artificial intelligence applied to additive manufacturing. First, the section clarifies cold metal transfer (CMT) as an AM technique presenting some of its features and capabilities, subsequently comparing it to WAAM. This section is finished with a comparison between solid and cored wires, the latter a new need for fusion wire-based processes; pros and cons are given based on practical observations. The second section groups two classes of alloys additively manufactured by EBAM: Ti and NiTi alloys. EBAM is firstly introduced where general features of the process are presented, followed by process parameters, pros and cons. In sequence, the EBAM of Ti-64 alloy is shown with results based on microstructural aspects, thermal history, and phase transformation. The EBAM of NiTi follows a different approach, exploring recent publications of this newborn processing of NiTi alloys. Comparisons with techniques (WAAM and LPBF) show how EBAM may influence functional properties. Therefore, the focus is put on the influence of processing on the transformation temperatures and superelastic behaviour. The outlook comprises two wire-based AM techniques: resistance welding and liquid metal AM. The former recently introduced and baptised Joule Printing gained visibility due to its astonishing printing speed. Liquid metal was introduced two decades ago and is based on the Lorentz force to drop the feedstock. General information is exposed to understand each process. Another important segment of AM bases its layering method on friction, specifically friction stir welding. Features of this process are indicated, and practical examples are depicted with Al and Ni alloys. Ultrasonic metal AM is also represented afterwards, with basic information about the process and examples of components. At last, the effects of coupling artificial intelligence to additive manufacturing and its benefits are enlightened, with applications for both machine and deep learning as well as future trends in, e.g., topology optimisation. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the existing Fulcrum RLNC approaches are generation based, leading to large packet delays due to the joint processing of all packets in a generation in the encoder and decoder. In order to avoid these delays, we introduce Fulcrum Sliding Window (FSW) coding. We introduce two flavors of FSW: Fulcrum Non-systematic Sliding Window (FNSW), which divides a given generation into multiple partially overlapping blocks, and Fulcrum Systematic Sliding Window (FSSW), which intersperses coded packets among the uncoded (systematic) transmission of the source packets in a generation. Our extensive evaluations indicate that FSSW substantially reduces the in-order packet delay (for moderately large generation and window sizes down to less than one fourth) and more than doubles the encoding and decoding (computation) throughput compared to generation-based Fulcrum.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The thermal issues generated from friction are the key obstacle in the high-performance machining of titanium alloys. The friction between the workpiece being cut and the cutting tool is the dominant parameter that affects the heat generation during the machining processes, i.e., the temperature inside the cutting zone and the consumed cutting energy. Besides, the complexity is associated with the nature of the friction phenomenon. However, there are limited efforts to forecast the friction coefficient during the machining operations. In this work, the friction coefficients between the titanium alloy against zirconia ceramics lubricated by minimum quantity lubrication were recorded and measured using a universal mechanical tester pin-on-disc tribometer. Then, we proposed two models for forecasting the friction coefficient which are trained and tested on the recorded data. The two predictive models are based on autoregressive integrated moving average and gated recurrent unit deep neural network methods. The proposed models are evaluated through a set of exhaustive experiments. These experiments demonstrated that the proposed models can efficiently be used to reduce power consumption dedicated to monitoring the friction coefficients. Besides, they can reduce or avoid surface thermal damage by predicting the high level of friction coefficients in advance, which can be used as an alert to enable or readjust the lubrication parameters (fluid pressure, fluid flow rate, etc.) to maintain lower ranges of friction coefficients and power consumption.  © 2023 Ahmad Salah et al.},

Three distinctive pin geometries rotated at three speeds were used while other parameters were unchanged. The fitness and suitability of the model were verified by comparing the anticipated values with the experimental values. Macrographic and micrographic observations revealed that flawless joints with improved mechanical properties were fabricated at a peak temperature of 616 K (80 % melting temperature) when a taper cylindrical pin with a rotational speed of 818 rpm was employed.

This study examined the influence of FSW tool characteristics like shoulder and probe diameter and probe height on temperature, forces and failure load of welding of AA5083 alloy using the response surface methodology (RSM). The study’s setup consisted of three factors, three levels, and 17 experimental runs. In order to determine the welding temperature, a thermocouple was placed inside the samples. Also, the force during the process was measured using a fixture designed for this purpose. The generated model’s suitability at a 95% confidence level was assessed using an analysis of variance. Using RSM, a relationship was discovered between input parameters, including tool settings and output responses, such as temperature, force, and joint mechanical properties. This relationship was then used to discover the best process parameters using a hybrid multiobjective optimization. Hybrid multiobjective optimization recommends a probe diameter of 5.1 mm, a shoulder diameter of 17.63 mm, and a probe height of 3.86 mm as the optimum tool. This study discovered that the most important factors influencing temperature force and failure load were shoulder diameter, probe diameter, and probe height, respectively. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Weld defect detection is a crucial aspect for improving the productivity and quality of the welding process. Several non-destructive methods exist for the identification of defects post weld deposition. However, they only help assess the quality of the component and offer no inputs while the welding process is being performed. Real-time or in situ weld defect detection aids in the detection of defects during the welding process, allowing to take corrective measures or halt the welding to avoid further wastage of time and material. The current paper provides a brief description of various types of weld defects and the commonly used non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques used for identifying weld defects. It then proceeds to provide a detailed review of various methods available for in situ weld defect detection, classifying them based on their input signals. It also classifies the methods based on the type of algorithm used, along with an intuitive explanation of the commonly used algorithms in weld defect detection. The methods covered in this manuscript make use of different input signals that include audio, welding current and voltage, and optical signals also highlighting methods that use a combination of the abovementioned signals for in situ prediction of weld defects. A critical analysis of the efficacy, advantages, and drawbacks of each method is presented. Further, this work highlights a few research gaps identifying avenues for future research in this area. © 2022, International Institute of Welding.},

Properties like hardness and tensile strength were investigated to assess the mechanical performance of the welded alloys by considering parameters like welding speed, tool rotation speed, and the applied axial load. It could be seen from the results that a rotational speed of 1300 rpm, welding speed of 30 mm/min and an axial load of 9 kN provided maximum tensile strength and hardness to the FSW specimen.

	abstract = {Ultrasonic testing procedures are among the most extensively used techniques in non-destructive testing and non-destructive evaluation systems. Meanwhile, phased array inspection or phased-array ultrasonic testing techniques as a well-known type of ultrasonic testing in advanced non-destructive testing systems are utilized in numerous applications, including oil and gas, medical imaging applications, railway, automotive, marine, and aviation industries. Phased-array ultrasonic testing-based methods can also be used in a variety of weld inspections, bond testing, thickness profiling, flaw detections, corrosion inspections, and in-service crack detection. The rapidity, safety, easiness, affordable price, and accurate visualization of phased array in measuring the defect characteristics such as size, shape, depth, and orientation allow its wide usage and even as a substitute for other inspection methods like radiographic methods. In phased array methods, more than one sound wave is employed to enhance the reliability and flexibility of inspection through the operation of several transducer assemblies, involving 16 to 256 small individual elements. Titanium having many desirable properties like high strength to weight ratio found many industrial applications, which highly necessitates its persistent inspection. For this aim, the present study focuses on the application of the phased-array ultrasonic testing technique for inspecting Ti components specifically in additive manufacturing, welding inspections, and defect detection of complex geometries and composites. Moreover, modern applications and improved computation methods are discussed. The development of phased-array ultrasonic testing inspection systems, particularly high throughput and efficient in situ and mobile equipment, and new computation methods will open new horizons toward the highly sophisticated inspection procedures. © IMechE 2022.},

	abstract = {The world is undergoing a paradigm shift in how products are manufactured. The fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0, is given greater importance by industries and companies worldwide as they bridge the gap between technology and manufacturing processes. Digital manufacturing has become a key research area as it can boost the productivity of all manufacturing processes by using advanced techniques such as machine learning, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence. These techniques have been used in tandem with numerous hybrid additive manufacturing processes to increase precision, create unlimited complex geometries, reduce material waste, change the constraints of the part during manufacturing if needed, and reduce the capital requirement. However, conventional welding techniques were harmful to humans, provided a poor surface finish, and proved difficult for welding complex parts. With hybrid additive manufacturing techniques combined with conventional welding techniques, conventional welding processes have been automated, reducing human intervention. This can be done using some of the latest technologies and concepts invented, such as robots, cobots, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality. Some of these new concepts and technologies, such as machine learning, virtual reality, and the Internet of Things, can optimize various welding parameters and improve remote welding technology. In addition, this paper thoroughly explores four important IT-based domains of digital manufacturing used in welding processes: robots, the Internet of Things, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. These concepts have influenced traditional welding processes by presenting the various parameters used to examine the impact. In addition, this paper also considers the potential scope of research. Also, this paper would look at different digital manufacturing processes and how they are used to make hybrid parts based on additive manufacturing. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The joining of materials with different or even competing properties is of high industrial interest regarding resource-efficient production. Friction stir welding (FSW) has been employed to create high-quality joints of dissimilar material combinations. Many studies report both metallurgical bonding and form-fit to be the relevant joining mechanisms. While metallurgical bonding is driven by interdiffusion and occurs in almost every case, form-fit can only appear if the interface is deformed. The hooks of the deformed interface cause interlocking; however, they also result in an increased stress concentration. Hence, the hooking can either enhance or reduce the joint strength depending on their geometries. This study demonstrates an approach to predict the morphology of the cross-sectional interfacial area of friction-stir-welded multi-material joints. Image processing was used to convert cross sections of aluminum/copper lap joints into binary b/w images. Using Gaussian process regression, a data-driven model of the interfacial area’s morphology was constructed based on 13 data sets. The applicability of the resulting Gaussian process model was tested for seven data sets by comparing the algorithm’s morphological predictions with cross sections welded with test parameters that were not used for training. This allows to estimate, which joining mechanism is relevant or dominant for the overall joint strength. The predicted results agreed well with the actual cross sections. Recesses as well as hooks at the interfacial area were successfully predicted even for a limited number of training data. To enhance the space of possible uses of the model for subsequent applications (e.g., simulation of fracture mechanics), more input parameters can be implemented into the model. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Friction stir welding is a novel solid-state joining process which has been a major area of research due to its applications in joining lightweight alloys. Although this welding process has the inherent advantage of joining alloys at significantly lower temperatures when compared to conventional fusion welding processes, thereby reducing energy consumption and thermal residual stresses, the overall final strength and feasibility of the joint has been found to be highly sensitive to the choice of welding process parameters. Defects such as void formations in friction stir welds are extremely detrimental to the strength of the weld joint as it could lead to catastrophic failures, expensive breakdowns in components, rejection of parts and even loss of lives (Yusof and Jamaluddin, 2014) [1]. These voids in the weld act as discontinuities for the joint as a result of which, the joint strength is severely weakened. Hence, it is of utmost importance to avoid the welding conditions that contribute to the formations of the void defects in structurally critical metallic joints. This study proposes an improved classification model based on a hyperparameter tuned XGBoost classifier algorithm to predict the probability of void formations with raw welding process parameters as inputs. The data set consisted of 108 entries of experimental data collected from past literatures on void formation for the friction stir welding of three aluminium alloys, AA2024, AA2219, and AA6061. While each alloy has unique chemical composition and mechanical properties, the study later identifies that the choice of alloy is amongst the weaker contributors to the presence of void defects. The proposed tuned model could successfully classify the joints containing voids with an accuracy of 90% while both the decision-tree based model and the neural-network based model could classify with an accuracy of 83.3%. © 2023},

	abstract = {An unstable assembly gap is detrimental to the formation and performance of the pipeline butt girth weld joint. Therefore, a numerical model of an 18.4 mm-thick X80 pipeline girth weld by a homogeneous body heat source was established to investigate the effect of the butt gap on the joint temperature and stress field, and carrying capacity. The accuracy of the simulation results was verified by measuring the welding thermal cycle with a thermocouple. The investigation results showed that the weld pool, heat-affected zone (HAZ) width, and maximum circumferential stress of the joint rose with the increase in the butt gap. The tensile stress unfavorable to the joint quality was mainly distributed in the weld metal and partial HAZ, and the distribution areas gradually expanded as the gap increased. The Von Mises stress peak value of the joint appeared in the order of 3 mm > 2 mm > 1 mm > 0 mm gap, reaching the maximum of 467.3 MPa (3 mm gap). This variation trend is directly related to the improvement in welding heat input with increasing butt gaps. The maximum Von Mises stress of the joint was positively correlated with the carrying capacity of the pipeline, which diminished as the butt gap enlarged. The pipeline carrying capacity reached 17.8 MPa for the joint with no butt gap, and dropped to 13.1 MPa for the joint with a 3 mm gap. The relationship between the carrying capacity (P) and butt gap (C) was described by P = −0.125C2 − 1.135C + 17.715, through which the pipeline carrying capacity with other butt gaps can be predicted. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Welding is an essential fabrication process in any of the construction or manufacturing industries. Over the years, numerous welding techniques have been developed to fulfil the continuously changing requirements of the manufacturers as well as to keep up with the evolving materials. Any welding operation is associated with a number of input parameters, their interactions with the achievable weld quality and material properties that determine the success of the overall process. Due to time consuming nature of physical experiments and advancements in computing power and theories, in-silico parametric analysis and optimization of welding processes has gained significant attention in recent years. This paper endeavours to provide a timely comprehensive review of the existing literature on finite element modelling, predictive modelling and optimization of the welding processes. Due to numerous welding processes, an exhaustive review of all of them would exceed the limit of a single research paper. Thus, only three widely popular and versatile welding processes, i.e. metal inert gas (MIG) welding, tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding and friction stir welding (FSW) are considered in this review paper. The essence of more than 225 research articles is concisely presented here, which would make this paper an asset to the future researchers and practitioners. Thermo-mechanical finite element analysis of welding processes, and use of traditional experiment design plans, like orthogonal array, Box-Behnken design and central composite design are found to be extremely popular in the literature. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Center for Numerical Methods in Engineering (CIMNE).},

	abstract = {High-strength AA 2014 aluminium alloys are broadly employed for many applications because of their good mechanical properties, high strength-to-weight ratio, and better resistance to corrosion and are recyclable. The major problems in welding of AA 2014 aluminum alloy using a traditional joining process are partially melted zone, hot cracking, and alloy segregation. Cold metal transfer-welding (CMT) process is an advanced variant of gas metal arc welding process characterized by reduced heat input in which the welding wire is retracted during the short circuit which allows sufficient time for the weld to cool before placing each drop. In this investigation, the pulsed CMT welding process was chosen to weld high-strength AA2014 aluminium alloy under T6 condition. The joint tensile properties were compared with the parent material and correlated to the microstructural features. The defect-free weld was achieved at constant welding speed of 450 mm/min, welding current of 110 A, and electrode feed rate of 5550 mm/min. The joint weld using pulsed CMT yields a maximum strength of 303 MPa, extending joint efficiency up to 67%. It mainly refers to the beneficial effects of welding wire pulsing and dip and retreat motion which causes refining of dendritic grains in weld metal and enhances the strength of joints.  © 2021 Rajendran Chinnasamy et al.},

Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), a powder bed fusion AM process, has been dramatically accepted in various industries due to its versatility with several materials, including alloys. This comprehensive review article primarily explains the basic principle of the LPBF process, scientific and technological progress of several inter-related parameters, feedstock materials, produced properties/defects, and insights of numerical modelling to virtually understand the process behavior. Specific attention has been given to selective laser-meted (LPBFed) properties, driven through the microstructure formations and, thereby, concerning defects. The scope of the post-processing techniques to refine microstructure has also been discussed in this review paper. It has been identified that the defects are vital in LPBF process and are primarily governed by the process parameters. Therefore, a wisely chosen, optimized set of parameters can play a crucial role in minimizing defects considerably.

	abstract = {Friction stir welding is a solid-state welding process. The technology is used in high-precision applications such as aerospace. Thus, monitoring the weld quality is highly relevant for detecting inaccurate welds. Various studies have shown a significant dependence of the weld quality on the welding speed and the rotational speed of the tool. Frequently, an unsuitable setting of these parameters can be detected by visually examining the resulting surface defects, such as increased flash formation or surface galling. The visual inspection for these defects is often conducted by humans and is therefore associated with increased costs and personnel allocation. In this work, a deep learning approach to automatically detect irregularities on the weld surface is introduced. A total of 112 welds with a total length of 18.4 metres were made to train and test of the artificial neural networks. Colour images of the welds were made using a digital camera, while images of the weld surface topography were made with a three-dimensional profilometer. The approach consisted of a two-step procedure. First, an object detector using a neural network localised the friction stir weld on the image. Second, a neural network classified the surface properties of the weld seam. The object detector localised the friction stir welds with an Intersection over Union up to 89.5%. The best result in classifying the surface properties was achieved by using the topography images. Here, a classification accuracy of 92.1% was reached by the DenseNet-121 convolutional neural network. The results will form the basis for the future development of a parameter optimization method for friction stir welding. © 2019 SPIE.},

In this experimental research, an thermo mechanical process model was formulated to estimate the values of peak temperatures generated during the employment of FSW tools with four different pin geometries (namely cylindrical, taper cylindrical, square and triangle) for joining of AZ80A Mg alloy flat plates, to understand their significant role in influencing the size of the grains, their mechanical strength and in the quality of the joints. The peak temperature values of the formulated thermo mechanical process model are found to be consistent with that of the actual experimental results and exhibited relatively very small variation It was observed that the joints fabricated by taper cylindrical pin geometry was found to possess very fine sized grains, due to the generation of ideal peak temperature (i.e., 348 °C which is nearly 81–82% of the melting temperature of AZ80A Workpiece). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Cold metal transfer (CMT) is a novel technique of joining, which is an improvised version of the gas metal arc welding (GMAW) techniques, in which the wire of the filler metal is deliberately pulled backwards after the short circuit. The retracted wire aids the disengagement of droplets during the short circuit, thereby transferring the metal into the pool of molten without the support of electromagnetic force. Due to this, the input of heat is greatly reduced and spatter is eliminated to greater extent. Lower volume of heat makes the technique of CMT welding a more ideal one for joining thin sheets and plates. Employment of CMT welding technique curtails spatter, distortion of joints and also requires limited clean up. CMT have made it possible to join together Al and steel. In addition to this, in this technique, the length of the arc can be monitored and can be controlled easily through mechanical means. Therefore, the stability of the arc is perfect, irrespective of the surface to be joined and during faster rate of joining, thereby making it possible to employ the technique of CMT welding in all position and for any application. This paper reviews in brief, the history, applications and principle of operation of the CMT welding technique. In addition to these, the several types of recently evolved types of CMT welding techniques namely CMT pulse advanced, CMT advanced, CMT + P, CMT Dynamic and the research findings of several relevant experimental works were discussed in brief. © 2022},

	abstract = {New development on the modeling approaches is generally required to fusing the sensor data to the computational model in order to build up digital twins for the manufacturing processes. In this paper, we propose a modeling approach for building a digital twin for friction stir welding (FSW) based on a sensor-based numerical simulation. In the proposed approach, a novel iterative cyber-physics fusion algorithm is proposed to calculate the in-process 3D temperature field during FSW by fusing the measured temperature data to a ‘moving heat source’ analysis. Two FSW cases of commercial aluminum alloys AA2024 and AA6061 are analyzed to test the proposed modeling approach. It is demonstrated that the real-time calculating of the in-process 3D temperature field during FSW is highly feasible. When a timestep of 2.0 s is adopted, the proposed approach shows good reliability, as the average error between the measured and the calculated temperatures is less than 4 °C. More importantly, it is found that the calculation time for the whole welding process is shown to be less than the physical welding time. This allows that the sensor-based numerical simulation and the physical FSW process can be synchronized with a second-level temporal precision, which provides a viable cyber-physics fusion approach for digital twin modeling for the FSW process. © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers},

A tool with a cylindrical tapered pin geometry was made to traverse at varying speeds, from 20 mm/min to 45 mm/min. It was observed that the CDA 101 joints fabricated at 20 mm/min were entirely free of aws, while the joints fabricated at other traverse speeds of the tool were featured several weld aws. Grains in the center of the stir zone of the joints obtained at 20 mm/min were uniformly distributed and homogeneous due to the significant volume of frictional heat and sufficient stirring force.

	abstract = {The ferrite content of austenitic stainless steel welds seriously affects to perform stainless steel welds. Keeping the ferrite content at the lower limit can reduce the thermal crack sensitivity of the weld. At high temperature, high ferrite content will lead to embrittlement tendency of weld. The traditional determination methods mainly include magnetic method and metallographic method. Magnetic method is often used as a method to obtain data for predicting ferrite content. However, magnetic method has high requirements on sample size and surface finish. Metallographic methods are usually used as a supplement to magnetic methods because of their destructive and other disadvantages. Accurate prediction of ferrite content can reduce measurement work and facilitate the selection of parameters before welding. The most widely used magnetic method is WRC-1992 diagram, but the effect of welding parameters is not reflected. The neural network method improves the prediction accuracy, but it still has the limitation of insufficient consideration of welding parameters.

	abstract = {Purpose: In the present study, wire electro-spark machining of Titanium alloy is performed with the machining parameter such as spark-on time, spark-off time, current and servo voltage. The purpose of this study is to model surface roughness using machine learning approach for input/controllable variable. Machined surface examined using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and XRD methods. Design/methodology/approach: Full factorial approach has been used to design the experiments with varying machining parameters into three-level four factors. Obtained surface roughness was modeled using machine learning methods namely Gaussian process regression (GPR) and support vector machine (SVM) methods. These methods were compared for both training and testing data with a coefficient of correlation and root mean square error basis. Machined surface examined using scanned electron microscopy and XRD for surface quality produced and check migration of tool material to workpiece material. Findings: Machine learning algorithms has excellent scope for prediction quality response for the wire electric discharge machining (WEDM) process, resulting in saving of time and cost as it is difficult to find each time experimentally. It has been found that the proposed model with minimum computational time, provides better solution and avoids priority weightage calculation by decision-makers. Originality/value: The proposed modeling provides better predication about surface produced while machining of Ti6Al7Nb using zinc-coated brass wire electrode during WEDM operation. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Deep learning techniques, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformer models, have been shown to be effective in generating coherent and diverse sentences. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been widely used in natural language processing tasks, including automatic text generation. However, the traditional RNN suffers from the vanishing gradient problem, which hinders the learning of long-term dependencies. To address this issue, long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) models have been introduced that can selectively forget or update certain information in the hidden state. These models have been shown to improve the quality of automatically generated text by better capturing the long-term dependencies in the input data. © 2023 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Friction stir welding is an advanced joining technology that is particularly suitable for aluminum alloys. Various studies have shown a significant dependence of the welding quality on the welding speed and the rotational speed of the tool. Frequently, an inappropriate setting of these parameters can be detected through an examination of the resulting surface defects, such as increased flash formation or surface galling. In this work, two different learning-based algorithms were applied to improve the surface topography of friction stir welds. For this purpose, the surface topographies of 262 welds, which were performed as part of ten studies, were evaluated offline. The aim was to use reinforcement learning and Bayesian optimization approaches to determine the most appropriate settings for the welding speed and the rotational speed of the tool. The optimization problem was solved using reinforcement learning, specifically value iteration. However, the value iteration algorithm was not efficient, since all actions and states had to be iterated over, i.e., each possible parameter combination had to be evaluated, to find the best policy. Instead, it was better to solve the optimization problem directly using the Bayesian optimization. Two approaches were applied: both an approach in which the information from the other studies was not used and an approach in which the information from the other studies was used. On average, both the Bayesian optimization approaches found suitable welding parameters significantly faster than a random search algorithm, and the latter approach improved the result even further compared with the former approach. Future research will aim to show that optimization of the surface topography also leads to an increase in the ultimate tensile strength. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In the present work, multi-objective evolutionary (MOE) algorithm and machine learning (ML) techniques were employed to predict the age-hardening behavior of aluminum (Al) alloys in a wide range of processing conditions. For this purpose, data containing hardness, information on alloy compositions, and aging conditions (aging time and temperature) were extracted from previous works that reported the age-hardening of Al-Cu-Mg base alloys. Accordingly, 1591 cases were collected for various alloy compositions and processing conditions. Composition features (140) generated based on the alloy composition and element properties (atomic weight, electronegativity, etc.), and processing features (time and temperature) were subjected to a preprocessing using the MOE algorithm to reduce the number of features and use those which highly influence the hardness. MOE-processed features and counterpart hardness values are then employed in the learning process using various ML algorithms, including decision tree (DT), deep learning (DL), linear general model (GM), gradient boosted trees (GBT), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). The results show that the MOE algorithm's leveraging with ML learning processes can be successfully used to refine the features and build accurate ML predictive models compared to those created using other feature selection and preprocessing methods. In addition, the learning results showed that the predictive model built using the ensemble GBT algorithm exhibits the best performance among all models built based on other ML algorithms, where a relative error of 3.5% was recorded for the GBT-based model, and it could reproduce the experimental aging behavior of Al alloy. © 2021},

	abstract = {This study explores the effect of Vee bending process parameter on the springback (SB) behavior of aluminum (AA5052) alloy at sheet thickness of (2 and 3mm) with die-opening (22, 35, and 50 mm) and punch-holding time (0, 5 and 10 second) which were experimentally examined. Furthermore, to see the relative effect of process parameter on SB behavior, a qualitative approach of analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used, whereas multi linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) were applied to optimize the SB behavior on specified process parameters. The experimental results revealed that as punch holding time and sheet thickness increase, SB behavior reduced, whereas in case of die opening, opposite phenomena observed. ANOVA results revealed that punch-holding time had the greatest effect on SB, followed by die opening and sheet thickness. Two-way parametric interactional effects between punch-holding time and dieopening had a significant effect on SB behavior. By contrast, the interactional effects of sheet thickness were insignificant. The comparative study of MLR and ANN shows that The ANN has better (99% SB predictability) as compared to MLR (73% SB Predictability). Furthermore, the predicted results of both models were compared with actual experimental results. It was observed that the predicted results were approximately near with actual measurements, whereas the performance of MLR and ANN model were measured from sum of absolute error and the sum of the absolute error of ANN was about 12% of that of MLR model. Therefore, ANN produced a superior SB prediction performance compared with MLR.

The present study assessed the fatigue performance of newly developed weathering steels with high phosphorus content joined by friction stir welding (FSW) below A1 temperature, by which the heat affected zone (HAZ) softening and weld defects were successfully inhibited. The fatigue life of the FSW joints of three mild steels was evaluated and compared to the design curve. The accumulation of plastic deformation in different regions was analysed and various ratcheting behaviors were studied. The influence of weld defects on the fatigue life due to the inadequate downward loading was also classified. The results showed that the fatigue strength of three mild steels was much higher than the FAT112 design curve, and the S-N curves were extremely flat. The base metal region of the FSW specimens where the fracture usually occurred illustrated a larger accumulation of plastic deformation than the weld nugget. The fatigue fracture at the weld nugget was induced by weld defects and the fatigue life was decreased by as long as 14.7 times. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In the past few decades, additive manufacturing has evolved for the one-step fabrication of various complex, customized metallic components that cannot be easily and economically produced by other means. However, widespread applications and market penetration of such components are often hindered by the formation of common defects that affect part quality, reliability, and serviceability, and increase the cost. Here, for the first time, we show that a combination of physics-informed machine learning, mechanistic modeling, and experimental data can reduce the occurrence of common defects in additive manufacturing. By analyzing experimental data on the defect formation for commonly used alloys available in the disjointed, peer-reviewed literature, we identify several important variables that reveal the physics behind the defect formation. Values of those variables computed using a mechanistic model, when used in a physics-informed machine learning, provide the hierarchical importance of the variables on defect formation. In addition, based on the results of the physics-informed machine learning, we provide easy-to-use, verifiable, quantitative formalism that can be used in real-time to predict defects before experiments. The proposed methodology can help in reducing common defects such as balling, cracking, lack of fusion, porosity, and surface roughness, and solve other complex engineering problems beyond additive manufacturing. © 2021},

	abstract = {Real-time monitoring of laser-metal inert gas (MIG) hybrid welding plays a significant role in modern automatic production. In this paper, an innovative prediction model is proposed for laser-MIG hybrid welding process monitoring and weld defect detection. Specifically, the status of laser-MIG hybrid welding was monitored using a high-speed imaging system that could observe the visual information from the top and bottom of the weldment simultaneously. Then, the morphological features were extracted by image process algorithm. Furthermore, the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) was employed to analyze the time series of visual features, and the decomposed component intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and residue were inputted to the support vector machine (SVM) classification model. Finally, the EMD-SVM model was employed to evaluate the welding status of four weld formations, including sound weld, root humping, incomplete penetration and burn through. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of accuracy and robustness compared with traditional methods such as the backpropagation (BP) neural network, SVM, wavelet packet decomposition (WPD)-BP, WPD-SVM, and EMD-BP. This proposed method provides a novel and accurate approach to perform laser-MIG welding process monitoring and online defects detection. © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers},

	abstract = {Computer-aided design (CAD) is the use of computer-based software to aid in design modeling, design analysis, design review, and design documentation. Nevertheless, the benefits of CAD can be elevated in combination with artificial intelligence (AI), extended reality, and manufacturing. AI can create an intelligent graphics interface and change tedious design processes into sophisticated ones. In extended reality technology, simulation can take place in a 3D virtual environment, thereby providing excellent interaction and better analysis. In manufacturing, as seen in 3D printing technology, CAD systems can be directly connected to manufacturing to produce complex parts easily and rapidly. In this paper, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in CAD, as well as CAD application in extended reality and 3D printing is examined. The primary aim of this review is to present an overview of current state-of-the-art CAD and its applications, as well as to forecast its future prospects. The article is written using a systematic review of journal papers with a focus on a wide spectrum of potentially relevant researches on CAD. The benefits of incorporating AI into the CAD systems, the use of CAD in extended reality and 3D printing, and finally a brief discussion of issues that are pushing CAD to new levels are all discussed. Finally, the review concluded that the demand for several varied products based on a single object input, immersive and interactive simulation, and direct design-to-manufacturing integration is driving CAD to new levels. © 2022 The Authors},

Essentially, we investigate the performance of the bagged trees regression (BT) in forecasting the stress-strain curve of an aluminum alloy. This choice's motivation is due to BT's ability to improve the performance of machine learning models by combining multiple learners versus single regressors. Actual data was gathered by performing uniaxial tensile testing on both base material and joined using FSW at a deformation speed of 10-3s-1. Then, the performance of the BT model is compared to that of the Support Vector regression, and it proved to be more accurate. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The high-potential of lightweight components consisting of similar or dissimilar materials can be exploited by Solid-State Joining techniques. Whereas defects such as pores and hot cracking are often an issue in fusion-based joining processes, via solid-state joining processes they can be avoided to enable high-quality welds. To define an optimal process window for obtaining anticipated joint properties, numerous time and cost consuming experiments are usually required. Building a predictive model based on regression analysis enables the identification and quantification of process-property relationships. On the one hand, mechanical property and performance predictions based on specific process parameters are needed, on the other hand, inverse determination of required process parameters for reaching desired properties or performances are demanded. If these relations are obtained, optimized process parameter sets can be identified while vast numbers of required experiments can be reduced, as underlying physical mechanisms are utilized. In this study, different regression analysis algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees and random forests, are applied to the refill Friction Stir Spot Welding process for establishing correlations between process parameters and joint properties. Experimental data sets used for training and testing are based on a Box-Behnken Design of Experiments (DoE) and additional test experiments, respectively. The machine-learning based regression analyses are benchmarked against linear regression and DoE statistics. The results illustrate a decryption of relationships along the process-property chain and its deployment to predict mechanical properties governed by process parameters. © ESAFORM 2021 - 24th Inter.

	abstract = {Aluminum Profiles (APs) are aluminum materials obtained by hot melting and extruding aluminum rods. It has the characteristics of low cost, strong plasticity, easy processing, and recyclability, and therefore plays an important role in industrial production. However, defects such as Non-Conductive (NC), Scratch, Orange Peel (OP), and Dirty Point (DP) often occur during the production and processing of APs, which can seriously affect the quality of APs. In addition, surface defects of APs also have problems such as fuzzy regional definition, large-scale variation, imbalance of aspect ratio, and high inter-class defect similarity, making defect detection more challenging. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an attention-guided object detection algorithm called MA-YOLO, specifically for Surface Defect Detection (SDD) of APs. The algorithm is based on YOLOv5s. Firstly, the K-Means++ clustering algorithm is used to optimize the anchor boxes, which alleviates the problem of aspect ratio imbalance. Secondly, by improving the multi-scale Feature Fusion Network (FFN), the detection performance of the model to detect the defects with unbalanced aspect ratio is improved, and the adaptability of the model to defects of different scales is enhanced. Finally, a novel Max Pooling Average Pooling (MA) attention module is proposed to improve the overall detection performance of the model, especially for small-scale defects. Experimental results on the aluminum profile surface defect dataset show that MA-YOLO has better detection performance and superiority than the current mainstream object detection algorithms, and compared with the baseline YOLOv5s, the mAP50 and F1 score are increased by 2.9% and 2.2%, respectively, while keeping the model lightweight. This indicates that MA-YOLO has broad application prospects in the surface defect detection of APs.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Welding is a major manufacturing process that joins two or more pieces of materials together through heating/mixing them followed by cooling/solidification. The goal of welding manufacturing is to join materials together to meet service requirements at lowest costs. Advanced welding manufacturing is to use scientific methods to realize this goal. This paper views advanced welding manufacturing as a three step approach: (1) pre-design that selects process and joint design based on available processes (properties, capabilities, and costs); (2) design that uses models to predict the result from a given set of welding parameters and minimizes a cost function for optimizing the welding parameters; and (3) real-time sensing and control that overcome the deviations of welding conditions from their nominal ones used in optimizing the welding parameters by adjusting the welding parameters based on such real-time sensing and feedback control. The paper analyzes how these three steps depend on process properties/capabilities, process innovations, predictive models, numerical models for fluid dynamics, numerical models for structures, real-time sensing, and dynamic control. The paper also identifies the challenges in obtaining ideal solutions and reviews/analyzes the existing efforts toward better solutions. Special attention and analysis have been given to (1) gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) and gas metal arc welding (GMAW) as benchmark processes for penetration and materials filling; (2) keyhole plasma arc welding (PAW), keyhole-tungsten inert gas (K-TIG), and keyhole laser welding as improved/capable penetrative processes; (3) friction stir welding (FSW) as a special penetrative low heat input process; (4) alternating current (AC) GMAW and double-electrode GMAW as improved materials filling processes; (5) efforts in numerical modeling for fluid dynamics; (6) efforts in numerical modeling for structures; (7) challenges and efforts in seam tracking and weld pool monitoring; (8) challenges and efforts in monitoring of keyhole laser welding and FSW; and (9) efforts in advanced sensing, data fusion/sensor fusion, and process control using machine learning/deep learning, model predictive control (MPC), and adaptive control.  © 2021 by ASME.},

	abstract = {In metal-cutting operations, the surface roughness of the end product plays a significant role. It not only affects the aesthetic appearance of the end product but also signifies the product's performance in the long run. Products with a high surface finish have higher endurance limits with negligible local stresses. On the other hand, products with rough surfaces are subjected to high stresses when they are engaged in various mechanical operations with varying loads. Surface roughness depends on various machining factors such as feed rate, depth of cut, cutting speed, or spindle speed. Therefore, it is required to predict surface roughness for the given machining parameters to reduce the cost and increase the life of the end product. In this work, an attempt has been made to evaluate the surface roughness of AZ91 alloy during the end milling operation. In this regard, various state-of-the-art ensemble learning models have been adopted and compared with the proposed hybrid ensemble model. The proposed hybrid ensemble model is the integration of random forest, gradient boosting, and a deep multi-layered neural network. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, comparative analyses have been made in terms of mean square error, mean average error, and R2 score. The result shows that the proposed hybrid model gives minimum error for surface roughness.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Taylor impact tests involving the collision of a cylindrical sample with an anvil are widely used to study the dynamic properties of materials and to test numerical methods. We apply a combined experimental-numerical approach to study the dynamic plasticity of cold-rolled oxy-gen-free high thermal conductivity OFHC copper. In the experimental part, impact velocities up to 113.6 m/s provide a strain up to 0.3 and strain rates up to 1.7 × 104 s−1 at the edge of the sample. Microstructural analysis allows us to find out pore-like structures with a size of about 15–30 µm and significant refinement of the grain structure in the deformed parts of the sample. In terms of modeling, the dislocation plasticity model, which was previously tested for the problem of a shock wave upon impact of a plate, is implemented in the 3D case using the numerical scheme of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). The model includes an equation of state implemented in the form of an artificial neural network (ANN) and trained according to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of uniform isothermal stretching/compression of representative volumes of copper. The dislocation friction coefficient is taken from previous MD simulations. These two efforts are aimed at building a fully MD-based material model. Comparison of the final shape of the projectile, the reduction of the sample length and increase in the diameter of the impacted edge of the sample confirm the applicability of the developed model and allow us to optimize the model parameters for the case of cold-rolled OFHC copper. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {This review article provides a critical assessment of the progress made in computational modelling of metal-based additive manufacturing (AM) with emphasis on its ability to predict physical phenomena, concepts of microstructural evolution, residual stresses, role of multiple thermal cycles, and formation of multi-dimensional defects along with the achieved degree of experimental validation. The uniqueness of this article stems from the inclusion of comprehensive information on computational progress in the field of fusion-based, sintering-based, and mechanical deformation-based AM. A computational model's role in determining the process framework for the desired outcome of the set properties of the AM components is recognised while presenting the process-microstructure maps, thereby appraising computational ability towards the qualification of products. The inclusion of a detailed discussion on the bi-directional coupling of machine learning and physics-based computational models provides a futuristic roadmap for the digital twin of metal-based AM. © 2023 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining and ASM International Published by Taylor & Francis on behalf of the Institute and ASM International.},
