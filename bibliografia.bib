  abstract  = {The demand for lighter materials with suitable mechanical properties and a high resistance to corrosion has been increasing in the industries. Therefore, aluminum appears as an alternative due to its set of properties. The aim of this work was to evaluate residual stress levels and mechanical properties of welded joints of Aluminum-Magnesium alloy AA 5083-O using the Friction Stir Welding process. For mechanical characterization were performed a uniaxial tensile test, Vickers hardness, bending test and, finally, the determination of residual stresses. It was concluded that welding by FSW process with an angle of inclination of the tool at 3o, established better results due to better mixing of materials. The best results of tensile strength and a lower level of residual stresses were obtained using a tool rotation speed of 340 RPM with welding advance speed of 180 mm/min and 70 mm/min.},

  abstract = {Friction stir welding is a novel solid-state joining process which has been a major area of research due to its applications in joining lightweight alloys. Although this welding process has the inherent advantage of joining alloys at significantly lower temperatures when compared to conventional fusion welding processes, thereby reducing energy consumption and thermal residual stresses, the overall final strength and feasibility of the joint has been found to be highly sensitive to the choice of welding process parameters. Defects such as void formations in friction stir welds are extremely detrimental to the strength of the weld joint as it could lead to catastrophic failures, expensive breakdowns in components, rejection of parts and even loss of lives (Yusof and Jamaluddin, 2014) [1]. These voids in the weld act as discontinuities for the joint as a result of which, the joint strength is severely weakened. Hence, it is of utmost importance to avoid the welding conditions that contribute to the formations of the void defects in structurally critical metallic joints. This study proposes an improved classification model based on a hyperparameter tuned XGBoost classifier algorithm to predict the probability of void formations with raw welding process parameters as inputs. The data set consisted of 108 entries of experimental data collected from past literatures on void formation for the friction stir welding of three aluminium alloys, AA2024, AA2219, and AA6061. While each alloy has unique chemical composition and mechanical properties, the study later identifies that the choice of alloy is amongst the weaker contributors to the presence of void defects. The proposed tuned model could successfully classify the joints containing voids with an accuracy of 90\% while both the decision-tree based model and the neural-network based model could classify with an accuracy of 83.3\%.},

The aim is to enhance welding procedures, particularly in high-precision industries like aerospace and automotive. By incorporating four control parameters (Tilt Angle, Rotation Speed, Welding Speed, and Shoulder Diameter) and utilizing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) machine learning model, a Heterogeneous Ensemble Machine Learning (He-EM) approach is developed. The Artificial Multiple Intelligence System (AMIS) optimizes the decision fusion strategy of each technique, ensuring the model's effectiveness. Validated using diverse experimental design methods and three datasets, the proposed AMIS He-EM model outperforms existing techniques (GPR, SVM, HE-UWE, and HE-WEDE) by significant margins (35.12%, 24.92%, 22.31%, and 15.48% respectively). The model's robustness is demonstrated, as its performance remains consistent across different experimental design methods. The key finding of this research is the remarkable improvement in accuracy for predicting UTS, MH, and HI in AA7075 FSW. This study highlights the importance of incorporating four control parameters and utilizing the D-optimal design for efficient exploration of the input parameter space. The implications of this research are profound, offering opportunities to optimize welding procedures, improve product performance, and streamline manufacturing processes in industries relying on AA7075 FSW.},

  abstract  = {Friction stir welding is a method used to weld together materials considered challenging by fusion welding. FSW is primarily a solid phase method that has been proven efficient due to its ability to manufacture low-cost, low-distortion welds. The quality of weld and stresses can be determined by calculating the amount of heat transferred. Recently, many researchers have developed algorithms to optimize manufacturing techniques. These machine learning techniques have been applied to FSW, which allows it to predict the defect before its occurrence. ML methods such as the adaptive neurofuzzy interference system, regression model, support vector machine, and artificial neural networks were studied to predict the error percentage for the friction stir welding technique. This article examines machine learning applications in FSW by utilizing an artificial neural network (ANN) to control fracture failure and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect faults. The ultimate tensile strength is predicted using a regression and classification model, a decision tree model, a support vector machine for defecting classification, and Gaussian process regression (UTS). Machine learning implementation mainly promotes uniformity in the process and precision and maximally averts human error and involvement.},

Now-a-days, in many industrial applications the steels are replaced by non-ferrous alloys, in most cases by aluminum alloy. The aluminum 6061 alloy is most commonly used in aerospace and automobile industries. Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is considerably new joining process that has exhibited many benefits over traditional arc welding process including greatly reducing distortion and eliminating solidification. The FSW joints have higher tensile strength to weight ratio and finer micro structure. The samples were taken under the tool rotational speed of 1950, 3080 and 4600 rpm. The present study is done to think about the impact of input parameters on the tensile strength. The tensile quality is mostly influenced by tool speed. The parameters taken in this examination are tool rotational speed, feed rate and shoulder diameter. The greatest tensile strength is obtained at Tool Speed-3080 rpm, Feed Rate-20mm/min and Shoulder Diameter across 20mm. I.

ANN based approaches could model this welding process of INCOLOY 800H in both forward and reverse directions efficiently, which are required for the automation of the same. Five different training algorithms were used to train ANN for both forward and reverse mapping and ANN tuned force approach was used for optimization.

The results showed that GANN with 4-9-3 for forward and 4-7-3 for reverse mapping arrangement could outperform the other four approaches in most of the cases but not in all.

  abstract  = {Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a solid-state welding process used for welding similar and dissimilar materials. FSW is especially suitable to join sheet Al alloys, and this technique allows different material couples to be welded continuously. In this study, 1050 Al alloys and commercially pure Cu were produced at three different tool rotation speeds (630, 1330, 2440 rpm) and three different tool traverse speeds (20, 30, 50 mm/min) with four different tool position (0, 1, 1.5, 2 mm) by friction stir welding. The influence of the welding parameters on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the joints was investigated. Tensile and bending tests and microhardness measurements were used to determine the mechanical properties. The microstructures of the weld zone were investigated by optical microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM) and were analyzed in an energy dispersed spectrometer (EDS). Intermetallic phases were detected based on the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis results that evaluated the formation of phases in the weld zone. When the welding performance of the friction stir welded butt joints was evaluated, the maximum value obtained was 89.55% with a 1330 rpm tool rotational speed, 20 mm/min traverse speed and a 1 mm tool position configuration. The higher tensile strength is attributed to the dispersion strengthening of the fine Cu particles distributed over the Al material in the stir zone region.},

This work aims to evaluate the influence of the tool rotation and welding speed on microstructure and mechanical properties of AA 7075-T651 aluminum alloy welded joints by FSW process. Therefore, four welded joints obtained with different welding and tool rotation speed were subjected to tensile and microhardness tests. The microstructures of the welded joints were evaluated through analysis by optical microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The retreating side of the welded joints showed a higher occurrence of microstructural welding defects. Welded joints with yield strength (YS) 50% higher than those of base metal and with ultimate tensile strength up to 380 MPa were achieved.},

The study explores friction stir welding (FSW), a cost-efficient process known for producing high-quality joints in these materials. The experiment involved the welding of dissimilar aluminum alloys (AA5086-H111 to AA6061-T6) using a novel pin tool design with welding parameters such as holding time, pin tool length, tool spindle speed, and linear speed fine-tuned through a design of experiment (DOE) approach. A comparative analysis of two tool designs revealed that the newly introduced design substantially improved mechanical properties, particularly tensile strengths, by 18.2% relative to its predecessor. It is noteworthy that FSW joint efficiency is 83% when using a normal tool design in comparison with 92.2% when using a new tool design at similar FSW parameters. The new tool achieved the parameter values leading to the maximum tensile strength of 317 MPa with 3 mm thickness (Th), 25 s holding time (Tt), 0.1 mm dimension (L), 1600 rpm spindle speed (SS), and 30 mm/min feed velocity (Fr). In comparison, the normal tool achieved a maximum UTS of 285 MPa, 5 mm Th, 25 s Tt, 0.3 mm L, 800 rpm SS, and 90 mm/min Fr. The new tool design, with longitudinal and circular grooves, improves heat input for plastic deformation and alloy mixing during welding. Subsequent analysis of the joint's microstructure and microhardness shows its similarity to the original alloys.},

The substance utilized in the experiment was a mixture of aluminum alloys AA5083 and AA5061. An ensemble machine learning model was created to predict the UTS of the friction stir-welded seam, utilizing 11 FSW parameters as input factors and the UTS as a response variable. The proposed approach used the Gaussian process regression (GPR) and the support vector machine (SVM) model of machine learning to build the ensemble machine learning model. In addition, an efficient technique using a differential evolution algorithm to optimize the weight for the decision fusion was incorporated into the proposed model. The effectiveness of the model was evaluated using three datasets. The first and second datasets were divided into two groups, with 80% for the training dataset and 20% for the testing dataset, while the third dataset comprised the test data to validate the model's accuracy. The computational results indicated that the proposed model provides more accurate forecasts than existing methods, such as random forest, gradient boosting, ADA boosting, and the original SVM and GPR, by 30.67, 49.18, 16.50, 48.87, and 49.33 %, respectively.

  abstract = {The highest strength-to-weight ratio criterion has fascinated curiosity increasingly in virtually all areas where heft reduction is indispensable. Lightweight materials and their joining processes are also a recent point of research demands in the manufacturing industries. Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is one of the recent advancements for joining materials without adding any third material (filler rod) and joining below the melting point of the parent material. The process is widely used for joining similar and dissimilar metals, especially lightweight non-ferrous materials like aluminum, copper, and magnesium alloys. This paper presents verdicts of optimum process parameters on attaining enhanced mechanical properties of the weld joint. The experiment was conducted on a 5 mm 6061 aluminum alloy sheet. Process parameters; tool material, rotational speed, traverse speed, and axial forces were utilized. Mechanical properties of the weld joint are examined employing a tensile test, and the maximum joint strength efficiency was reached 94.2%. Supervised Machine Learning based Regression algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Algorithm were used. The results showed that the Random Forest algorithm yielded highest coefficient of determination value of 0.926 which means it gives a best fit in comparison to other algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Welding optimization is a significant task that contributes to enhancing the final welding quality. However, the selection of an optimal combination of various process parameters poses different challenges. The welding geometry and quality are influenced differently by several process parameters, with some exhibiting opposite effects. Consequently, multiple experiments are typically required to obtain an optimal welding procedure specification (WPS), resulting in the waste of material and costs. To address this challenge, we developed a machine learning model that correlates the process parameters with the final bead geometry, utilizing experimental data. Additionally, we employed a reinforcement learning algorithm, namely stochastic policy optimization (SPO), with the aim to solve different optimization tasks. The first task is a setpoint-based optimization problem that aims to find the process parameters that minimize the amount of deposited material while achieving the desired minimum level of penetration depth. The second task is an optimization problem without setpoint in which the agent aims to maximize the penetration depth and reduce the bead area. The proposed artificial intelligence-based method offers a viable means of reducing the number of experiments necessary to develop a WPS, consequently reducing costs and emissions. Notably, the proposed approach achieves better results with respect to other state-of-art metaheuristic data-driven optimization methods such as genetic algorithm. In particular, the setpoint-based optimization problem is solved in 8 min and with a final mean percentage absolute error (MPAE) of 2.48% with respect to the 42 min and the final 3.42% of the genetic algorithm. The second optimization problem is also solved in less time, 30 s with respect to 6 min of GA, with a higher final reward of 5.8 from the proposed SPO algorithm with respect to the 3.6 obtained from GA.},

Fewer air involved in the weld pool, better stability of the keyhole and the easier escape of bubbles from the weld pool are the three ways to suppress the porosity. In both arc-laser hybrid welding (ALHW) and LAHW processes, the columnar grains are found in the fusion boundary, while equiaxed grains are observed in the weld center. In LAHW process, although the grain size is larger, the strength of the joint is higher, which is attributed to less porosity formation, the slight loss of Mg, more second-phase particles with uniform distribution, and the formation of dislocation with higher density in the joints.},

In order to reduce such emissions, several efforts have been made by researchers in the transport sector, such as the development of electric motorization, the development of hybrid engines, the use of biofuels and the use of light alloys. The use of light alloys such as aluminum and magnesium in vehicles can reduce the emission per kilogram of vehicles drastically, however, it is still necessary to develop effective and more agile methods of the dissimilar joints of these materials. Some authors have studied the friction stir welding of AZ31B magnesium alloys and AA7075-T6 aluminum alloys in order to determine better process parameters to enable this bond, however, few articles have been published in order to evaluate the influence of tool geometry on such properties. In this sense, this article aims to evaluate the influence of friction welding tool pin geometry as smooth cylindrical pin, threaded cylindrical pin, conical and hexagonal pin configurations in the formation of the mixed zone of welds manufactured by the FSW process. For this purpose, AZ31B and AA7075-T6 alloys were welded by FSW with welding speed of 75 mm/min, tool rotation speed of 565 rpm, offset of 0.5mm and inclination of the tool geometry in relation to the plates to be welded of 3º, the joints were evaluated for their macro and microstructures and Vickers hardness with a load of 100 gf. It was possible to observe that the joints welded with the threaded cylindrical pin tool presented stir zones free of macroscopic defects, similar hardness values for the four tools studied and the presence of a thin layer of intermetallics between TMAZ and SZ on the AZ31B side.},

  abstract = {Purpose The main purpose of the present work is to evaluate, the microstructural and mechanical properties of friction stir welded plates of AZ91D magnesium alloy with 3 mm thickness, and to determine the optimum range of welding conditions.  Design/methodology/approach Microstructure and fractographic studies were carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Vickers micro hardness test was performed to evaluate the hardness profile in the region of the weld area. The phases in the material were confirmed by X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Transverse tensile tests were conducted using universal testing machine (UTM) to examine the joint strength of the weldments at different parameters.  Findings Metallographic studies revealed that each zone shown different lineaments depending on the mechanical and thermal conditions. Significant improvement in the hardness was observed between the base material and weldments. Transverse tensile test results of weldments had shown almost similar strength that of base material regardless of welding speed. Fractographic examination indicated that the welded specimens failed due to brittle mode fracture. Through these studies it was confirmed that friction stir welding (FSW) can be used for the welding of AZ91D magnesium alloy.  Research limitations/implications In the present study, the welding speed varied from 25 mm/min to 75 mm/min, tilt angle varied from 1.5 ° to 2.5 ° and constant rotational speed of 500 rpm.  Practical implications Magnesium and aluminum based alloys which are having high strength and low density, used in automotive and aerospace applications can be successfully joined using FSW technique. The fusion welding defects can be eliminated by adopting this technique.  Originality/value Limited work had been carried out on the FSW of magnesium based alloys over aluminum based alloys. Furthermore, this paper analyses the influence of welding parameters over the microstructural and mechanical properties.},

In order to investigate the effects of friction stir welding (FSW) on microstructures and mechanical properties of Mg-5Al-3Sn magnesium alloy, the hot-extruded alloy plates were butt welded by FSW at various welding speeds. The results showed that the alloy was jointed without defects. After FSW, β-Mg17Al12 phase was dissolved into α-Mg matrix while Mg2Sn phase with high dissolution point and good thermal stability remained in the nugget zone (NZ). With increasing welding speed, the maximum (0002) pole intensity in the NZ first decreased and then increased, and grain size of α-Mg matrix decreased arising from lower heat input while some intermetallic particles coarsened at higher welding speed due to solid state diffusion and less applied stress. In all cases the tensile properties of the alloy after FSW decreased due to the softened region at the heat-affected zone (HAZ), the dissolution of β-Mg17Al12 phase, the residual stress and dislocation content in the TMAZ, the textural variation and the secondary phase changes. The elastic behavior of weld joints was different from the BM due to the dissolution of β-Mg17Al12 particles.},

Aluminum and magnesium sheets were successfully joined using FSW and the samples were tested for the mechanical and microstructural properties to determine the optimal welding variables. The welding process was performed using different feed rates, offset values and tool profiles while spindle speed was kept constant. The joining sheets were heated with hot air blowing behind the tool during the FSW process to prevent crack formation due to the residual stress. The tests results showed that the better tensile and impact strengths were obtained with square tool a constant spindle speed of 500 rev/min, a feed rate of 20 mm/min, and a tool offset of 0.2 mm. It was also observed the formation of tunnel because of low melting temperatures and insufficient mixing caused to reduction of area and notch effect in the welded zone.},

The effects of tool rotational speed and welding speed on the microstructure and tensile properties were evaluated. The grain size was observed to increase after FSW, resulting in a drop of microhardness across the welded region from about 70 HV in the base metal to about 50 HV at the center of the stir zone. The obtained Hall–Petch type relationship showed a strong grain size dependence of the hardness. The aspect ratio and fractal dimension of the grains decreased towards the center of the stir zone. The welding speed had a significant effect on the microstructure, with larger grains at a lower welding speed. The yield strength and ultimate tensile strength increased with increasing welding speed due to a lower heat input. A lower rotational speed of 500rpm led to higher yield strength than a higher rotational speed of 1000rpm. The friction stir welded joints were observed to fail mostly at the boundary between the weld nugget and thermomechanically affected zone at the advancing side. Fracture surfaces showed a mixture of cleavage-like and dimple-like characteristics.},

In this work, the second of a two-part study, an ML approach is presented that offers accelerated digital design of Mg alloys. A systematic evaluation of four ML regression algorithms was explored to rationalise the complex relationships in Mg-alloy data and to capture the composition-processing-property patterns. Cross-validation and hold-out set validation techniques were utilised for unbiased estimation of model performance. Using atomic and thermodynamic properties of the alloys, feature augmentation was examined to define the most descriptive representation spaces for the alloy data. Additionally, a graphical user interface (GUI) webtool was developed to facilitate the use of the proposed models in predicting the mechanical properties of new Mg alloys. The results demonstrate that random forest regression model and neural network are robust models for predicting the ultimate tensile strength and ductility of Mg alloys, with accuracies of ∼80\% and 70\% respectively. The developed models in this work are a step towards high-throughput screening of novel candidates for target mechanical properties and provide ML-guided alloy design.},

This review firstly demonstrates the importance of grain refinement in improving strength of Mg alloys by comprehensively comparing with other strategy, e.g., precipitation strengthening. Dynamic recrystallization (DRX) plays a crucial role in refining grain size of Mg wrought alloys. Therefore, secondly, the DRX models, grain nucleation mechanisms and the related grain refinement abilities in Mg alloys are summarized, including phase boundary, twin boundary and general boundary induced recrystallization. Thirdly, the newly developed low-RE containing Mg alloy, e.g., Mg-Ce, Mg-Nd and Mg-Sm based alloys, and the RE-free Mg alloys, e.g., Mg-Al, Mg-Zn, Mg-Sn and Mg-Ca based alloy, are reviewed, with the focus on enhancing the mechanical properties mainly via the grain refinement strategy. At the last section, the perspectives and outstanding issues concerning high-performance Mg wrought alloys are also proposed.

  abstract = {Deformation twinning is profusely activated in the Mg alloys due to lower critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) compared to the non-basal slip systems (prismatic {\textless}a{\textgreater} and pyramidal {\textless}c + a{\textgreater}) and plays a significant role in texture reorientation, grain refinement and enhancement of mechanical performance. Twinning is a sequential process comprising twin nucleation, twin propagation and twin growth, hence several intrinsic and extrinsic parameters that facilitate or suppress the process have been critically reviewed. The dependence of twinning on the grain size, deformation temperature, favorable grain orientation and shear strain have been thoroughly discussed in the context of published literature and an attempt has been made to provide a benchmark conclusive finding based on the majority of works. Furthermore, the subsequent effect of twinning on the mechanical performance of Mg alloys, including ductility, formability and tension-compression asymmetry has been discussed in detail. Lastly, the stability of twins, including stress and thermal stability, is summarized and critical issues related to pertinent bottlenecks have been addressed.},

  abstract = {Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is an innovative joining technology, which is suitable quickly evolved and been employed for various industrial applications. Currently, FSW is primarily used to produce joints with high quality requirements (e.g. joint strength, leak tightness). Furthermore, the number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that intend to include FSW in their manufacturing lines is constantly growing. For these companies, it is essential that FSW can easily be integrated in the production line without requiring expertise to set up the welding process. Various studies have already shown that controlling the welding temperature during FSW is a key to ensuring that the quality requirements can be met. Additionally, employing temperature control facilitates the set-up of welding tasks for complex workpiece geometries or seam trajectories. However, the most challenging step on the path to controlling the welding temperature is the measurement of the welding temperature, which usually requires elaborate and delicate measuring equipment.

The aim of this paper is to introduce an indirect temperature measurement system based on the acquisition of the torque and process forces during FSW. As a major benefit, no additional temperature measuring equipment is needed because the process torque and process forces can be determined from the power consumptions of the motors. The correlation between the torque, the process forces and the welding temperature was described by a mathematical model of the FSW-process. 

For this, a grey box approach based on physical relations and empirical factors was employed. The empirical factors where obtained from the literature. Finally,
the accuracy of the model was validated experimentally.},

The same phenomenon was found with both methods: with an increase of MnCl2 content in the flux paste, the depth/width ratio of weld bead increased gradually. Arc spectroscopy revealed that the temperature of the arc in the FC wire weld process was higher than that in the normal wire with flux pasted onto plate weld process.

Friction stir welding (FSW) for joining dissimilar materials has been considered better than the conventional fusion welding process because of metallurgical concerns. In this study, dissimilar joints were made between the AA6061 (A), AZ31B (B), and AZ91D (C) combinations based on the varying advancing side (AS) and retreating side (RS). The dissimilar joints prepared by the FSW process were further characterized by tensile testing, impact testing, corrosion testing, fracture, and statistical and cost analysis. The results revealed a maximum tensile strength of 192.39 MPa in AZ91 and AZ31B, maximum yield strength of 134.38 MPa in a combination of AA6061 and AZ91, maximum hardness of 114 Hv in AA6061 and AZ31B, and lowest corrosion rate of 7.03 mV/A in AA6061 and AZ31B. The results of the properties were supported by photomicrographic fracture analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations. Further, the performance of dissimilar joints was statistically analyzed and prioritized for preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) method.},

However, softening was frequently occurred in FSW Mg joints because of the presence of a β-type fiber texture. The present study aims to understand the influence of texture distribution in stir zone (SZ) on deformation behavior and joint strength of FSW Mg welds. AZ31 Mg alloy joints were obtained by FSW with two sets of welding speed and rotation rate. Detailed microstructure and texture evolutions were examined on Mg welds by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) techniques. It was found that the changes of welding parameters can affect texture distribution and the characteristic of texture in the transition region between SZ and thermal-mechanical affected zone (TMAZ). As a consequence, the activation ability of basal slip and extension twinning was changed, which therefore influenced joint strength, inhomogeneous plastic deformation and fracture behaviors. The present work provided some insights into understanding the texture–property relationship in FSW Mg welds and indicated that it is effective to tailor the joint performance by texture control.},

  abstract = {In the midst of the modern world in which we currently live, the search for materials that combine a satisfactory resistance/weight ratio has been a stage of worldwide interest in the industrial sector, especially the transport sector. In this context, magnesium alloys gain prominence when used in automobile components to improve their efficiency. However, one of the challenges in applying these materials is obtaining welded joints, as this type of material has presented limitations when subjected to conventional processes by electric arc fusion. In this sense, the solid-state friction stir welding process appears as a good alternative for joining these alloys. Therefore, this work aims to evaluate the influence that welding parameters have on the microstructure and mechanical properties of welded joints made of AZ31 magnesium alloy. The joints were produced based on different conditions defined through experimental planning using a three-axis universal milling machine. Microstructural and mechanical characterization of the welded joints were carried out, according to optical microscopy and uniaxial tensile and Vickers microhardness tests, respectively, as well as fractographic analysis of the fracture surfaces via scanning electron microscope. The results demonstrated a good visual appearance of the joints, showing the absence of cracks and lack of filling. Different levels of mechanical resistance were obtained, reaching 197 MPa. The average grain sizes of the mixing zone were smaller than those of the base material, showing reductions of up to 74%. Resulting in obtaining higher levels of microhardness in cases of smaller grain size. The fractographic images showed a considerable presence of dimples, characterizing ductile fracture of the welded joints. Therefore, the varied temperature levels resulting from the different welding parameter conditions imposed were decisive for the microstructural behavior, which consequently influenced the mechanical behavior.},

  abstract = {The use of light alloys in the transport sector is essential to increase the efficiency and autonomy of vehicles. In this sense, alloys with good mechanical resistance and low specific weight, such as aluminum alloys AA7075 and magnesium alloys AZ31B, stand out. However, these alloys are difficult to weld using conventional welding processes, and unconventional processes such as friction stir welding (FSW) appear as a good alternative to the weldability of these alloys. The present work dealt with the evaluation of the influence of the tool pin geometry on the microstructure and mechanical properties in joints of dissimilar alloys AA7075 and AZ31B welded by the FSW process, the pin geometries studied were: smooth cylindrical, threaded cylindrical, smooth conical and hexagonal faceted. The welds were carried out using an automatic universal milling machine, with rotation of 565 RPM, advance of 75 mm/min, offset of 0.5 mm for the magnesium side, inclination angle of 3° and advance on aluminum. Tensile, root bending and microhardness tests were carried out, and microstructure analysis was also carried out. fracture surface and chemical analysis by EDS. In the tensile test, all joints failed in the elastic region, well below the yield limit of the AZ31B alloy, all joints had similar tensile strength limits. In the bending test, the highest load supported (717 N) was on the joint welded with the smooth cylindrical tool. In the microhardness test, in the mixing zone, the welded joints had an intermediate result between the two base metals. In the microstructure analysis, the joint that showed the most defects was the one welded with the smooth conical geometry pin and the one that showed the least was the joint welded with the threaded cylindrical geometry pin. In the analysis of the fracture surface, it was found that it was a brittle fracture, followed by catastrophic failure for all joints. In the chemical analysis, the presence of intermetallic compounds was found in the joint welded with the smooth cylindrical tool. It was evident that among the tool pins used, the threaded cylindrical and smooth cylindrical pins were those that provided the best results, in terms of the macro and microstructure and the mechanical properties of the AA7075 and AZ31B alloy joints welded by the FSW process.},

  abstract  = {Magnesium (Mg) has become a focus in the transportation industry due to its potential in reducing fuel consumption and gas emissions while improving recyclability. Mg alloys are also known for their low neutron absorption, good resistant of carbon dioxide as well as thermal conductivity which makes them suitable for use in industrial equipment for nuclear energy. there has been an increasing interest in the research and development of Mg alloys. These are the lightest of all metallic structural materials and are approximately 33\% lighter than aluminium (Al) and 75\% lighter than ferrous (Fe) alloys and have excellent specific mechanical properties. In this work, FSW of AZ31B Alloy was examined at the various rotational speeds of 900 -1440 rpm, with fixed welding speed of 40mm/min and 2° tool tilt angle using an HSS tool. The mechanical properties were compared for the different rotational speeds. The quality of FSW joints is dependent on input value of heat and material flow rate, which are prejudiced by process parameters., higher rotation speeds may cause abnormal stirring, resulting in a tunnel defect at the weld nugget due to increased strain rate and turbulence.},

The research addresses the challenges posed by differences in material properties and the complex nature of FSW, where traditional experimental methods are time-consuming and costly. FSW experiments were conducted under a variety of conditions, and the resulting temperature data were utilized as input for a heat transfer analysis. The maximum temperature and temperature gradient obtained from the analysis were employed as input variables for training the ANN. The ANN was optimized using the Hyperband tuner and validated against experimental results.

With that purpose, a ZK30 magnesium alloy was friction stir processed (FSP) using three different severe conditions to obtain fine grain microstructures (with average grain sizes between 2 and 3 µm) prone to extensive superplastic response. The three friction stir processed samples clearly deformed by grain boundary sliding (GBS) deformation mechanism at high temperatures. The maximum elongations to failure, well over 400% at high strain rate of 10−2 s−1, were reached at 400 °C in the material with coarsest grain size of 2.8 µm, and at 300 °C for the finest grain size of 2 µm. Nevertheless, the superplastic response decreased at 350 °C and 400 °C due to thermal instabilities and grain coarsening, which makes it difficult to assess the operative deformation mechanism at such temperatures. This work highlights that the machine learning models considered, especially the ANN model with higher accuracy in predicting flow stress values, allow determining adequately the superplastic creep behavior including other possible grain size scenarios. © 2024},

Accurate torque prediction in FSW is crucial for weld quality, process efficiency, and energy conservation. Many researchers achieved models for torque based on experimental research, yet the models were limited to a specific type of material. In recent years, the use of machine learning techniques has increased in industry in general and in welding in particular. In this study, a machine learning model was prepared based on artificial neural networks, and Shapley-Additive Explanations were used to predict the rotational torque from 287 experiments that had been conducted in several previous studies. The achieved model has remarkable predictive performance, with an R-squared of 99.53% and low errors (MAE, MAPE, and RMSE). Moreover, a machine learning polynomial regression was examined for comparisons. A parametric importance analysis revealed that rotational speed, plate thickness, and tilt angle significantly affect torque predictions, while the rest of the variables had minimal importance. © 2024 University of Tehran.

  abstract               = {The industry sector has long been seeking methods to enhance its manufacturing system control, production, and monitoring, while maintaining the quality of its products and reducing costs and time. One method for achieving a more comprehensive understanding of the manufacturing processes is the identification of a corresponding process window (PW). However, there is no globally accepted definition of process window, which is principally used in different manufacturing processes. In some cases, it is combined with operating window or process map concepts. In light of the aforementioned consideration, this article puts forth a definition of process window, drawing upon the various notions and aspects related to the optimal process parameters selection as discussed in the literature. Furthermore, the identification of key controllable process parameters and the criteria to delimit boundaries of desired parts are described as aspects to identify the corresponding process window. Moreover, this paper provides an overview of the techniques used to establish a process window, principally through the application of machine learning techniques (ML) and design of experiments (DOE). Furthermore, the uncertainty intrinsic to the manufacturing process and the methodologies employed to identify the process window are examined. In conclusion, this article emphasises the necessity of transferring these models to new materials or machines, which will require further investigation in future research. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.},

O objetivo principal é dar uma visão prática e teórica dos processos de soldagem, tanto dos processos por fusão como processos no estado sólido. Com esse enfoque torna-se mais fácil o entendimento dos fenómenos, como a transferência metálica, a transferência de calor durante a soldagem, a solidificação da poça de fusão, a origem de trincas etc. Todos esses fenómenos estão intimamente relacionados com os processos de soldagem e, consequentemente, com a soldabilidade.},
