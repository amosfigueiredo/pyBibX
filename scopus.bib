	abstract = {The friction stir welding (FSW) process allow manufacturers the flexibility to use the process in a wide variety of materials in different application areas. It has been discovered that the FSW works well for joining the metals that are difficult to weld and also the thickness of welds has been considered as an important factor. The use of prediction models helps in achieving the sustainable development goals. The purpose of this research is to investigate the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) tools to forecast and optimize FSW process parameters to achieve high quality welds. An expert system uses a combination of FEM and ANN models to study and simulate the relationship between the FSW parameters and the mechanical properties of the welded joints. Specifically, the goal of this study is to better understand the techniques have been used. The goal of this study is to determine the range of rotation speed, to understand defects and the best mechanical properties required for welds. According to the findings of this experiment, the ANN modelling performs fairly admirably for estimating FSW parameters and the helpful in predicting the behaviour of welds. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature 2023.},

	abstract = {Friction stir welding (FSW) is a key technique for welding high-strength aluminium alloys without melting, making it indispensable in industries where maintaining material integrity is of utmost importance. The current study presents a novel application of the Hungarian method, a combinatorial optimization technique, to determine the optimal FSW parameters for AA7075 and AA6082 alloys. The weldments were produced by applying different feed rates (40, 50 and 60 mm/min) and rotational speeds (1000, 1100 and 1200 rpm) in accordance with a L9 orthogonal array. The optimal combination was, a feed rate of 40 mm/min and a rotational speed of 1200 rpm, yielding an ultimate tensile strength of 162.26 MPa, a percentage elongation of 2.56 and an impact energy of 2.5 J/mm². The microstructural investigation showed substantial improvement in the grain refinement of the weld nugget, which significantly contributed to improved mechanical properties. However, under optimal welding conditions, the weld nugget exhibited a significant negative corrosion potential compared to the base metals, indicating a higher susceptibility to corrosion. These results show that the Hungarian method provides a systematic approach to optimizing FSW parameters, but it might be necessary to adapt post-weld treatment to lower propensity to corrode. This study illustrates not only the application of the Hungarian method in the optimization of operating parameters of FSW but also establishes a base for further studies dealing with combinatorial optimization problems in welding and other manufacturing processes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Heat input (HI) is the major factor that affects the surface quality, microstructure and mechanical properties of the deposition during the additive friction stir deposition (AFSD) process. Effect of HI on the microstructure and mechanical performance of the AFSDed AA6061 has been in-depth explored via adjusting the values of traverse speed (v) and layer thickness (t). Results indicate that deposition with a higher HI promotes the material flow behavior as well as the plastic deformation, which effectively enhances the grain refinement and structural uniformity, and avoids the formation of defects. Meanwhile, TEM results confirm that the enhanced HI leads to the formation of a higher volume fraction of the finer precipitations (Mg2Si and AlFeSi phases), which assists in suppressing abnormal grain growth phenomenon and improves the bonding strength of the deposition. As HI decreases, the transfer efficiency of materials clearly reduces because of the incompletely softened materials, causing less plastic deformation and poor interlayer bonding strength of the deposition. The deposition with the lowest HI displays the worst tensile properties with the lowest micro-hardness (107 HV0.5), YS (273 MPa) and UTS (303 MPa). © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {This paper presents the modeling of tensile properties of friction stir welding (FSW) AA2219-T8 aluminum alloy thick plate for launch vehicle tanks using the artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA), specifically developed for this work. FSW experiments of 18 mm thick AA2219-T8 plate and subsequent tensile tests were conducted. A single-layer feedforward neural network model was developed based on rotational speed and welding speed as inputs and the joint tensile strength as output, with a network topology of 2–5–1. Correlation performance of considered ANN model with network topology expressed in terms of mean absolute percent error was found to be 0.52%, with a correlation coefficient value of 0.96101. The objective function from ANN was taken by GA to determine the combination of process parameters that yields an optimal tensile strength. The feasible optimal process parameter of a combined ANN-GA was identified as a rotational speed of 312 r/min and welding speed of 132 mm/min with an average joint efficiency of 83.17%. Effective validation experiments were conducted, and the experimental results agreed with the ANN-GA optimization results with an acceptable error of only 1.13%. The weld, subjected to the confirmation test, was investigated by means of microstructure analysis and fracture analysis. Evaluation of the developed model proved to be efficient enough for the development of FSW thick AA2219-T8 with required tensile strength. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering 2024.},

	abstract = {With remarkable learning capabilities and swift operational speeds, artificial intelligence (AI) can assist researchers in swiftly extracting valuable patterns, trends, and associations from subjective information. Tribological behaviors are characterized by dependence on systems, evolution with time, and multidisciplinary coupling. The friction process involves a variety of phenomena, including mechanics, thermology, electricity, optics, magnetics, and so on. Hence, tribological information possesses the distinct characteristics of being multidisciplinary, multilevel, and multiscale, so that the application of AI in tribology is highly extensive. To delineate the scope, classification, and recent trends of AI implementation in tribology, this review embarks on exploration of the tribology research domain. It comprehensively outlines the utilization of AI in basic theory of tribology, intelligent tribology, component tribology, extreme tribology, bio-tribology, green tribology, and other fields. Finally, considering the emergence of “tribo-informatics” as a novel interdisciplinary field, which combines tribology with informatics, this review elucidates the future directions and research framework of “AI for tribology”. In this paper, tribo-system information is divided into 5 categories: input information (I), system intrinsic information (S), output information (O), tribological state information (Ts), and derived state information (Ds). Then, a fusion method among 5 types of tribo-system information and different AI technologies (regression, classification, clustering, and dimension reduction) has been proposed, which enables tribo-informatics methods to solve common problems such as tribological behavior state monitoring, behavior prediction, and system optimization. The purpose of this review is to offer a systematic comprehension of tribo-informatics and to inspire new research ideas of tribo-informatics. Ultimately, it aspires to enhance the efficiency of problem-solving in tribology. (Figure presented.). © The author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Age hardening stands as a crucial strengthening process for aluminium (Al) alloys. However, determining the optimal ageing conditions has traditionally relied on resource-intensive trial-and-error methods. To streamline the design of Al alloys, this study introduces a novel feature screening-assisted machine learning (ML) approach to explore age-hardening behaviour across varying compositions and heat treatment parameters, focusing on yield tensile strength (YTS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and elongation (EL). A comprehensive pool of features, incorporating alloy composition and fundamental elemental properties, was generated to provide metallurgical insights for ML predictions. Subsequently, feature screening methodologies, including correlation analysis, feature elimination, and multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA), were employed to identify key features from the vast feature pool, balancing model complexity and prediction accuracy. Employing support vector regression models trained on these optimized feature sets, we demonstrate enhanced prediction accuracy for strength properties while maintaining model simplicity for EL, with minimal impact on accuracy. In addition, experimental results further validate the method's ability to reproduce ageing curves across all three mechanical properties for both commercialized and newly designed Al alloys. © 2024 The Authors},

Ultimate tensile strength (UTS) increased by 6 % in the skin direction and 12.8 % in the flange direction for UFSW compared to FSW. SEM analysis indicated enhanced ductility in UFSW fractures. These results demonstrate UFSW's superiority in improving thermal management, microstructural properties, and mechanical performance of welded joints. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Fiction stir welding (FSW) of a naturally aged (T4) 2195 Al-Li alloy was conducted to study the effect of post-weld artificial aging (AA) and rolling + artificial aging (R + AA) on microstructure and mechanical properties of the FSW joints. Grain features were analyzed by electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) technology, and precipitates were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) along [011]Al and [001]Al zone axes. Mechanical properties of the joints were evaluated through micro-hardness and tensile testing. The results indicate that grain development, including grain orientation, grain boundary components and dislocation density, varies within different regions of the As-welded joints due to complicated thermal-mechanical history. The alloying elements mostly exist as Guinier-Preston zones in the base material (BM) with a few formations of δ'/β′, and slightly precipitate into T1 in the heat affected zone (HAZ), form σ in the thermal-mechanical affected zone (TMAZ), as well as develop T1 and S′ in the nugget zone (NZ) after FSW. The lowest hardness zone (LHZ) exhibits elevated precipitation levels, generating coarse T1 and grain boundary precipitates with evident σ and precipitate free zone. The overall precipitation level of the As-welded joints remains minor, resulting in a slight decrease in hardness at the LHZ. Post-weld AA promotes many T1 formations, enhancing the joint strength and hardness. As a result, the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the joints increases from 440 MPa to 506.5 MPa, while the elongation decreases from 13.5 % to 3.4 %. Furthermore, hardness profiles transform from a low-amplitude wave curve to a high-amplitude W-shaped curve, generating a significant LHZ due to the minimal precipitation of T1. Pre-rolling deformation can enhance dislocation density and low angle grain boundaries (LAGBs), promoting the nucleation of high-density, fine T1 during artificial aging, and especially improves precipitation ability of the LHZ, leading to an elevated hardness increment in the region after AA. Compared to the Joint-AA, both strength and elongation of the Joint-R + AA increase, obtaining 530.5 MPa and 3.9 %, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},
