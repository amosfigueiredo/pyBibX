Abstract = {Thin AZ31 magnesium alloy sheets, i.e., 2 mm thick, are welded by
   Friction Stir Welding (FSW) in butt joint configuration using gap width
   up to 1.15 mm. All welds present good surface finishing and no internal
   defects, except for the weld produced using the maximum gap width. A
   reduction of the weld thickness within the Stir Zone is seen with the
   increase in gap width, leading to a maximum thickness reduction of
   8.5\%. Microstructure and Vickers hardness investigations reveal no
   influence of the gap width on these properties. Up to a gap width of
   0.51 mm, a slight decrease in the Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) is
   observed with increasing gap width. For larger gap widths, the UTS, as
   well as the fracture strain, are constant. To keep the metallurgical
   integrity, a maximum gap width of 1 mm seems acceptable for joints of
   thin AZ31 magnesium alloy sheets produced by FSW. (c) 2021 The Authors.

   stiffness joint},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ADVANCED JOINING PROCESSES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This study presents a comparative analysis of friction stir welding
   (FSW) and underwater friction stir welding (UFSW) of AZ31 magnesium
   alloy in T-configuration, emphasizing the effects on heat distribution,
   material properties, and mechanical performance. Simulation results
   revealed a more uniform heat distribution in both welding techniques,
   with the hottest area on the advancing side. The maximum temperatures
   recorded at the shoulder-workpiece contact were 404 degrees C for FSW
   and 349 degrees C for UFSW, a 13.6 \% reduction in UFSW. Material
   velocity at the trailing edge was 63 mm/s for FSW and 42 mm/s for UFSW,
   showing a 34 \% decrease due to lower heat generation in UFSW. Strain
   rates were 450 s-1 for FSW and 420 s-1 for UFSW. Grain size in the stir
   zone was 26 micrometers for FSW and 21 micrometers for UFSW, a 19 \%
   reduction. Ultimate tensile strength (UTS) increased by 6 \% in the skin
   direction and 12.8 \% in the flange direction for UFSW compared to FSW.
   SEM analysis indicated enhanced ductility in UFSW fractures. These
   results demonstrate UFSW's superiority in improving thermal management,
   microstructural properties, and mechanical performance of welded joints.},

Abstract = {A 20 mm-thick AZ31 Mg alloy plate was welded by friction stir welding,
   and the microstructure and mechanical properties of the joint were
   characterized in five layers along the thickness direction. The results
   showed that the grain size in the stir zone was uneven due to different
   welding temperatures and temperature drop rates. Different strong
   textures formed in different zones of the joint were mainly related to
   the material flow behavior. The yield strength and ultimate tensile
   strength (UTS) of the layered samples gradually increased from the top
   to the bottom surfaces of the joint. The elongation first increased from
   9.5\% to 10.5\% and then decreased to 6.0\% along the thickness of the
   joint. The UTS of the whole joint reached 88.5\% that of the base
   material. The main strengthening mechanism of the joint was fine-grain
   strengthening.},

Abstract = {A two-step double-side friction stir welding (DS-FSW) technique was
   proposed to join 20 mm thick Mg-Y-Nd magnesium alloy plates. FSW was
   first carried out on one side of the butt joint, and then the plates
   were left-right reversed for the other side welding. The DS-FSW joint
   was free of defects and the weld nugget zone (NZ) showed fine equiaxial
   grains. An overlap zone with ultrafine grain (similar to 2.19 mu m) and
   dispersive particles existed between the two welding tracks, beneficial
   to the integrity of the joint. The ultimate tensile strength
   (sigma(UTS)), yield strength (sigma(0.2)), and elongation rate (delta)
   of the joint were 277. 6, 204.1 MPa, and 7.27\%. A high joint efficiency
   (sigma(UTS) ratio between the joint and parent material) was achieved at
   similar to 82.6\%.},

Abstract = {In this study, we compared two different methods of Friction Stir
   Welding (FSW) of AZ31B magnesium alloy sheets. The effects of the
   welding process on the mechanical properties and microstructural joints
   were investigated by metallographic analysis by light microscopy,
   Vickers microhardness tests, tensile tests at room temperature and
   analysis of the fracture zone after tensile tests by means of a scanning
   electron microscope (SEM). From the results it is shown that in the
   technique with double welding, on both sides, compared with the
   technique welding from one side only, the mixing zone presents a greater
   homogeneity, a minor dimension of the grain and a hardness with
   symmetrical distribution of the profiles. In addition, macroscopic
   defects present in single joints have been significantly reduced in
   those with welding from both sides. From the tensile tests, there was an
   increase in the tensile strength (UTS) of about 9\% comparing double
   with single pass and a final elongation (EU) increased by 25\% with the
   arrangement FSW-AS AS than the individual. From the analysis of the
   fracture zone with a scanning electron microscope at high resolution, it
   I is noted that the fracture is of type transgranular in both I samples
   welded from two sides.},

Abstract = {he alloy needed for friction stir welding must be able to fracture
   during the solidification and joining processes. To overcome some of
   these problems solid state welding processes have been identified as
   alternative and Friction stir welding process (FSW) is one found to be
   more prominent to join simple to complex geometries. In this
   investigation, FSW of AZ91D magnesium alloy is undertaken with cerium
   microparticles embedded into the weldment in order to produce a metal
   matrix composite at the stir zone. Design/methodology/Approach: AZ 91D
   magnesium alloy materials are friction welded by keeping cerium powder
   between the plates to be joined before the joining process. Magnesium
   alloy is the type of raw material that used for various mechanical
   industries since it has the good thermal conductivity, and lightweight.
   The solid state joining process employs friction stir welding. The
   commercial Mg alloys consists of various elements like Al, Mn, and Zn.
   Taguchi L9 OA is employed for the experimentation and three factors
   namely rotational speed, Feed of Tool and tilt angle of tool are used.
   The results are analyzed with entropy weighted TOPSIS method. The
   overall outcome is predicted and confirmation test results are compared
   with it.},

Abstract = {The present study investigates the effect of two parameters of process
   type and tool offset on tensile, microhardness, and microstructure
   properties of AA6061-T6 aluminum alloy joints. Three methods of Friction
   Stir Welding (FSW), Advancing Parallel-Friction Stir Welding (AP-FSW),
   and Retreating Parallel-Friction Stir Welding (RP-FSW) were used. In
   addition, four modes of 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 mm of tool offset were used
   in two welding passes in AP-FSW and RP-FSW processes. Based on the
   results, it was found that the mechanical properties of welded specimens
   with AP-FSW and RP-FSW techniques experience significant increments
   compared to FSW specimens. The best mechanical and microstructural
   properties were observed in the samples welded by RP-FSW, AP-FSW, and
   FSW methods, respectively. Welded specimens with the RP-FSW technique
   had better mechanical properties than other specimens due to the
   concentration of material flow in the weld nugget and proper
   microstructure refinement. In both AP-FSW and RP-FSW processes, by
   increasing the tool offset to 1.5 mm, joint efficiency increased
   significantly. The highest weld strength was found for welded specimens
   by RP-FSW and AP-FSW processes with a 1.5 mm tool offset. The peak
   sample of the RP-FSW process (1.5 mm offset) had the closest mechanical
   properties to the base metal, in which the Yield Stress (YS), ultimate
   tensile strength (UTS), and elongation percentage (E\%) were 76.4\%,
   86.5\%, and 70\% of base metal, respectively. In the welding area,
   RP-FSW specimens had smaller average grain size and higher hardness
   values than AP-FSW specimens.},

Abstract = {In bobbin friction stir welding (BFSW), frictional heat input is
   simultaneously applied to the top and bottom surface of a workpiece by
   the rubbing action of the tool shoulders. Consequently, a relatively
   homogeneous microstructure is obtained in BFSW welds compared to the
   conventional FSW. In the current study, we performed BFSW bead-on-plate
   experiments on Mg alloy AZ31B with the goal to study evolution of
   microstructure and resulting tensile behavior of the welded material. We
   used three different combinations of intense process parameters which
   were intentionally chosen to be outside of the norm for BFSW i.e., tool
   rotational speeds > 1500 rpm and constant translational speed of 10
   mm/min. The BFS weldments showed the classic heat affected zone (HAZ), a
   small but discernible thermomechanical affected zone (TMAZ) and a large,
   near rectangular stir zone (SZ). The SZ consisted of a bimodal
   microstructure similar to the base material but some degree of grain
   refinement was also observed, which was more prominent on the retreating
   side of SZ. BFS welded specimen showed maximum of 67\% and 48\% joint
   efficiency (ratio of weld UTS to base material UTS) at room temperature
   and 200 degrees C, respectively. Fracture of specimens occurred in
   TMAZ/SZ interface and SZ, in room and elevated temperature tested
   specimens, respectively. Large number of twins were observed near
   fracture surface of the room temperature tensile tested specimen while
   coalescence of microcracks led to fracture at elevated temperature.},

Abstract = {AZ91D (Mg alloy) and A356 (Al-7Si) were fabricated by friction stir
   welding (FSW) at different process parameters, affecting the welded
   joints' mechanical properties. The results demonstrated that preferred
   properties were observed when AZ91D was placed on the advancing side.
   Mechanical properties, microstructure, elemental mapping, and
   fractography were analyzed by optical microscopy (OM), scanning
   microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive x-ray spectrograph, etc. The
   primary Al and Mg diffraction peaks were present, and Al12Mg17 and
   Al3Mg2 were intermetallic in all of these joints. This occurred due to
   the inter-diffusion performance of Al and Mg atoms in the welding and
   formed intermetallic compounds. The Al12Mg17 phase mixed with the Mg
   phase has preferentially lowered to the weld surface where the AZ91D
   plate was placed, and legitimate liquation may occur and be observed in
   the eutectic microstructures. The maximum ultimate tensile strength
   (UTS) of 90.57 MPa was perceived at tool rotational speed (TRS) of 900
   rev/min with a traverse speed (TS) of 100 mm min(-1), and the lower UTS
   (76.63 MPa) was found at TRS of 700 mm min(-1).},

Abstract = {Mg-Al-Sn magnesium alloys have bright future in application because of
   good properties without rare earth elements. To study the effects of
   rotation rate on microstructures and mechanical properties of Mg-5Al-1Sn
   alloy after friction stir welding (FSW), extruded plates were butt
   welded by FSW with various rotation rates at constant other parameters.
   The results showed that after FSW, Mg17Al12 phase with poor thermal
   stability was dissolved, while Mg2Sn phase remained due to high
   dissolution point and good thermal stability. The hole-type defects were
   observed at 600 rpm, and the weld joint was with no defects at 800
   similar to 1100 rpm. The weld joint at 800 rpm gave a maximum ultimate
   tensile strength (UTS), which was 91\% of the base material (BM). After
   FSW, both UTS and elongation of weld joints decreased compared with the
   BM, caused by the soften region between nugget zone (NZ) and
   thermo-mechanically affected zone (TMAZ), the dissolution of Mg17Al12
   phases, the residual stress and dislocation content in the TMAZ, and the
   textural variation. With increasing rotation rate from 600 to 1100 rpm,
   the UTS of weld joints first increased and then decreased, while the
   elongation kept mostly unchangeable due to the common action of
   multifactors.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Applications of non-ferrous light metal alloys are especially popular in
   the field of aerospace. Hence it is important to investigate their
   properties in joining processes such as welding. Solid state joining
   process such as friction stir welding (FSW) is quite efficient for
   joining non-ferrous alloys, but with thick plates, challenges increase.
   In this study, Mg alloy plates of thickness 11.5 mm were successfully
   welded via single-pass FSW. Due to the dynamic recrystallization, grain
   size in the stir zone was reduced to 16 mu m which is approximate to 15
   times smaller than the parent material. The optimized rotational speed
   and traverse speed for optimum weld integrity were found to be 710 rpm
   and 100 mm/min, respectively. A sound weld with 98.96\% joint
   efficiency, having an Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) of 161.8 MPa and
   elongation of 27.83\%, was accomplished. Microhardness of the nugget was
   increased by 14.3\%.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe weld joint mechanical properties of friction stir welding
   (FSW) are majorly reliant on different input parameters of the FSW
   machine. The study and optmization of these parameters is uttermost
   requirement and aim of this study to increase the suitability of FSW in
   different manufacturing industries. Hence, the input parameters are
   optimized through different soft computing methods to increase the
   considered objective in this study. Design/methodology/approachIn this
   research, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), yield strength (YS) and
   elongation (EL) of FSW prepared butt joints of AA6061 and AA5083
   Aluminium alloys materials are investigated as per American Society for
   Testing and Materials (ASTM E8-M04) standard. The FSW joints were
   prepared by changing the three input process parameters. To develop
   experimental run order design matrix, rotatable central composite design
   strategy was used. Furthermore, genetic algorithm (GA) in combination
   (Hybrid) with response surface methodology (RSM), artificial neural
   network (ANN), i.e. RSM-GA, ANN-GA, is exercised to optimize the
   considered process parameters. FindingsThe maximum value of UTS, YS and
   EL of test specimens on universal testing machine was measured as 264
   MPa, 204 MPa and 14.41\%, respectively. The most optimized results (UTS
   = 269.544 MPa, YS = 211.121 MPa and EL = 17.127\%) are obtained with
   ANN-GA for the considered objectives. Originality/valueThe optimization
   of input parameters to increase the output objective values using hybrid
   soft computing techniques is unique in this research paper. The outcomes
   of this study will help the FSW using manufacturing industries to choose
   the best optimized parameters set for FSW prepared butt joint with
   improved mechanical properties.},

Abstract = {In this work, friction stir welding (FSW) was carried out for the flat
   butt welding tests of Al/Mg dissimilar alloys by introducing Ni foil
   interlayer with different thickness. The effect of the thickness of
   interlayer on microstructure and mechanical properties of the FSW joints
   was explored. The results revealed that with the increase of the
   thickness of Ni, the effective bearing area of the weld nugget zone
   (WNZ) increased. It achieved the maximum value when the thickness of
   interlayer was 0.3 mm, and a dense `onion rings' structure which was
   composed of the cross distributions trips of magnesium alloy, aluminium
   alloy and the intermetallic compounds (IMCs), as well as the Ni
   particles of varying sizes were formed. Compared to the joint without
   introducing Ni, the introduction of Ni made the joints generate Mg2Ni
   and the Al3Mg2 was partially replaced and led to the ultimate tensile
   strength (UTS) increased by 13.5\%.},

Abstract = {Six millimeters thick extruded ZK60 plate was successfully friction stir
   welded at a rotation rate of 800 rpm and a traverse speed of 100mn/min.
   Friction stir welding (FSW) resulted in breakup and dissolution of MgZn2
   phase and remarkable grain refinement in the nugget zone. Relatively
   weak basal texture on the transverse plane of the nugget zone was not
   the dominant factor for determining the mechanical properties of the
   ZK60 weld. As-welded joints failed on the nugget zone with ultimate
   tensile strength (UTS) reaching 87\% of the parent material. After
   aging, the precipitation of the fine MgZn2 particles increased the
   mechanical properties of the weld significantly with the UTS reaching
   94\% of the parent material and the fracture occurring in the
   heat-affected zone. The fracture locations under both as-welded and aged
   conditions were consistent with the lowest hardness distribution of the
   welds. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The concept of Friction Stir Welding (FSW) technique was invented in
   year 1991 and since then many research have been done in the same field.
   To utilize the technique in various materials, many additional heat
   sources had been tested successfully and many such hybrid FSW methods
   came up. Electric Resistance Friction Stir Welding has been invented as
   one of the hybrid technology and produces less tear and wear of the tool
   with fewer defects of the joint produced. This study has been done to
   find the effect of secondary source of energy by electric assistance to
   FSW for improving the efficiency of the weld and to study the effect of
   various process parameters to improve the property of the weld joint of
   CS to IS 2062 Grade B. Design of Experiment has been applied to study
   the influence of the process parameters viz tool speed (rpm), electric
   current (Amps) and feed on the UTS of the weld. The joint has also been
   tested for checking the variation of the weld efficiency and hardness of
   the joint due to change in process parameters. The optimization of the
   process parameters has been done to obtain maximum Tensile strength,
   weld efficiency and hardness. The results of the optimization has been
   found to be indicating that due to the effect of addition of secondary
   heat source of electric current, the welding efficiency and hardness
   value has been found higher than the specimen joined without the
   secondary source. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Effect of Tool Positioning Factors on the Strength of Dissimilar
   Friction Stir Welded Joints of AA7075-T6 and AA6061-T6},
Journal = {MATERIALS},

Abstract = {Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a solid-state bonding technique. There
   are many direct and indirect factors affecting the mechanical and
   microstructural properties of the FSW joints. Tool offset, tilt angle,
   and plunge depth are determinative tool positioning in the FSW process.
   Investigating the effect of these factors simultaneously with other
   parameters such as process speeds (rotational speed and translational
   speed) and tool geometry leads to a poor understanding of the impact of
   these factors on the FSW process. Because the three mentioned parameters
   have the same origin, they should be studied separately from other
   process parameters. This paper investigates the effects of tilt angle,
   plunge depth, and tool offset on Ultimate Tensile Stress (UTS) of joints
   between AA6061-T6 and AA7075-T6. To design the experiments,
   optimization, and statistical analysis, Response Surface Methodology
   (RSM) has been used. Experimental tests were carried out to find the
   maximum achievable UTS of the joint. The optimum values were determined
   based on the optimization procedure as 0.7 mm of tool offset, 2.7
   degrees of tilt angle, and 0.1 mm of plunge depth. These values resulted
   in a UTS of 281 MPa. Compared to the UTS of base metals, the joint
   efficiency of the optimized welded sample was nearly 90 percent.},

Abstract = {In joining of AM20 magnesium alloy using friction stir welding process;
   Al and Zn are used as alloying element at the joint interface to act as
   an interlayer material. Mechanical and metallurgical properties of the
   joints with and without interlayer materials are compared. Defect free
   joints with sound mechanical properties are obtained with suitable
   alloying element at optimized parameter settings. Joints with Al and Zn
   interlayer results in 77\% and 90\% of ultimate tensile strength (UTS)
   of base material (BM), respectively. On the other hand, it is observed
   that without interlayer the UTS of the joint is only 65\% of BM.
   Fractograph analysis of the tensile tested specimens reveal ductile
   fracture in the joints with interlayer whereas without interlayer mixed
   fracture is observed in the joints. Maximum flexural strength with Zn
   interlayer is around 87\% of the BM. The micro hardness increased from
   bottom to top surface of the weld with maximum hardness at the nugget
   compared to other zones. Weld specimens with Al and Zn interlayer give
   higher hardness compared to without interlayer cases. The influences of
   the alloying element on the metallurgical properties are characterized
   by phase analysis. The addition of appropriate amount of Al in Mg
   substrate increases the contents of Al-base solid solution namely
   Al12Mg17 and AlMg intermetallic compounds that eliminates stress
   concentration and hinders crack propagation resulting in improved
   tensile strength. The addition of Zn with Mg substrate formed MgZn
   eutectoid structure with Mg7Zn3 structure and unreacted Mg resulting in
   improved mechanical properties.},

Abstract = {This study was aimed at characterizing the microstructure, texture and
   tensile properties of a friction stir welded AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy with
   varying tool rotational rates and welding speeds. Friction stir welding
   (FSW) resulted in the presence of recrystallized grains and the relevant
   drop in hardness in the stir zone (SZ). The base alloy contained a
   strong crystallographic texture with basal planes (0002) largely
   parallel to the rolling sheet surface and < 11 (2) over bar0 >
   directions aligned in the rolling direction (RD). After FSW the basal
   planes in the SZ were slightly tilted toward the TD determined from the
   sheet normal direction (or top surface) and also slightly inclined
   toward the RD determined from the transverse direction (or cross
   section) due to the intense shear plastic flow near the pin surface. The
   prismatic planes (10 (1) over bar0) and pyramidal planes (10 (1) over
   bar1) formed fiber textures. After FSW both the strength and ductility
   of the AZ31B-H24 Mg alloy decreased with a joint efficiency in-between
   about 75 and 82 pct due to the changes in both grain structure and
   texture, which also weakened the strain rate dependence of tensile
   properties. The welding speed and rotational rate exhibited a stronger
   effect on the YS than the UTS. Despite the lower ductility,
   strain-hardening exponent and hardening capacity, a higher YS was
   obtained at a higher welding speed and lower rotational rate mainly due
   to the smaller recrystallized grains in the SZ arising from the lower
   heat input. DOI: 10.1007/s11661-012-1382-3 (C) The Minerals, Metals \&

Abstract = {In this investigation, the 6061-T6 double-side friction stir welding
   (DS-FSW) plates with a thickness of 6 mm were rolled to different
   thickness. The microstructural evolution during rolling process was
   systematically studied based on the technologies of XRD, EBSD and TEM.
   The tensile test showed the evolution of yield strength (YS), ultimate
   tensile strength (UTS) and elongation during rolling process. The
   results revealed that the deformation mechanism of stirring zone (SZ)
   during rolling was grain rotation of fine grain. It contributed to a
   weaker dislocation density improvement in SZ. For the strengthening
   effect, all of the grain refine strengthening, precipitating
   strengthening, and solid solution strengthening of SZ were stronger than
   those in base metal (BM). However, the poor dislocation strengthening
   effect of SZ resulted in its lower YS compared with that of BM. The
   fracture of SZ depended on the debonding of plastic flow layers. The
   special fracture mode determined the lower UTS and elongation of SZ
   compared with those of BM.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the dissimilar friction stir welding (FSW) of
   AA2024 and AZ91D and aimed to explore the effect of rotation tool speed
   (RTS) on welding quality and the formation of intermetallic compounds
   (IMCs) in the welded region. The optimal welding parameters for
   achieving a sound weld were determined to be a traverse speed (TS) of 35
   mm/min and an RTS of 700 r/min. The presence of two specific
   intermetallic phases, Al3Mg2 and Al12Mg17, was observed in all joints,
   with Al12Mg17 showing a tendency to migrate toward the weld surface
   adjacent to the AZ91D plate, possibly resulting in constitutional
   liquation during solidification. The results revealed that the
   morphological characteristics and input heat significantly influenced
   the formation of IMCs. Moreover, the study highlighted that improper
   selection of processing parameters, particularly using lower RTS and TS,
   led to the development of dense layers of IMCs, such as Al12Mg17 and Mg
   + Al12Mg17, within the stir zone (SZ). Consequently, this led to a
   decrease in the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the FSWed joints. The
   highest UTS value of 147.26 MPa was achieved with an RTS of 700 r/min
   and a TS of 35 mm/min, while the lowest UTS value of 113.47 MPa was
   observed at an RTS of 500 r/min and a TS of 35 mm/min.},

Abstract = {In this research, dissimilar butt joining of an Al-Mg alloy (AA5083) to
   austenitic stainless steel (A316L) by using friction-stir welding (FSW)
   process was examined. FSW parameters and joint design were optimized,
   owning to achieve the best joint strength. The processed FSWs at the
   optimized traverse speeds of 16, 20, and 25 mm/min with the sound
   surface appearance were considered for further cross-sectional
   investigations, microstructural characterizations, and mechanical
   testings. In situ reactions at the interface of Al-Mg alloy and
   stainless steel during FSW processes were studied by using field
   emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and line-scan
   energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. As expected from
   the monitored thermal histories during FSW joining, the features
   indicating the formation of tunneling like defects were observed at low
   heat inputs (low w/v ratios). Moreover, some discontinuous thin
   intermetallic layers (with the thickness of similar to 0.5 mu m) were
   formed at the joint interface at the expressed processing conditions.
   Mechanical performances of the prepared dissimilar joints were assessed
   during transverse tensile loading and Vickers indentation micro-hardness
   testing. The joint strength ratio to the ultimate tensile strength (UTS)
   of the weakest base metal (BM) was improved up to similar to 93 \%, as
   all of the dissimilar FSWs failed from the Al-Mg base alloy, with a
   Vickers hardness enhancement of similar to 460 \% at the interface.},

Abstract = {In the present research work, AZ91 magnesium alloy and AA6082-T6
   aluminium alloy were joined by friction stir welding process. The
   comparison of microstructure and mechanical properties between different
   joints by varying the different materials on advance and retreating
   sides were mainly studied. Four different welds have been prepared to
   find the material mixing between the similar and dissimilar joints. The
   joint interfaces of the welds have been investigated by employing an
   optical microscope and scanning electron microscope. When Mg was placed
   on advancing side (AS), more aluminium content was soluble in nugget
   zone than the case where Mg was placed on the retreating side (RS). Thin
   intermetallic layer in the joint interface of Mg/Al and thick
   intermetallic layer with poor adhesion of the aluminium and magnesium
   have been observed in the dissimilar joints varying the sides. The
   highest UTS of 172.3 MPa was found for Mg-Al when Mg was placed on AS
   and lower UTS of 156.25 MPa was obtained when Mg was placed on RS.
   Hardness of 86 Hv and 89 Hv were observed in the Stir zone for the
   dissimilar AZ91 Mg alloy and AA6082-T6 Al alloy when AZ91Mg alloy was
   placed on the AS and on the RS respectively. Fractography was also
   carried out to find the mode of failure. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {In this work, dissimilar friction stir welding (FSW) of an Al-Mg alloy
   (AA5083) to austenitic stainless steel (A316L) by using nano sized SiC
   reinforcement was examined. Two optirhized traverse velocities of 16 and
   20 mm/min (and a constant rotational speed of 250 rpm) with the intact
   joint appearance were considered for investigation the effect of number
   of passes on microstructural and mechanical properties. Microstructure
   of the single-pass FSWed specimens containing reinforcements indicated
   large steel fragments and agglomerated SiC particles within the stir
   zone (SZ). Further FSW passes led to more homogenous distribution of SiC
   particles and steel fragments. Field emission-scanning electron
   microscopy (FE-SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were
   employed to analyze the in situ reactions at the joint interface and
   stir zone of Al-Mg alloy. No marks demonstrating the formation of
   tunneling defects were revealed at the stir zone up to six passes.
   Furthermore, streaks of tiny intermetallic particles together with steel
   fragments aligned in the direction of material flow. Tensile tests
   indicated that after six passes of FSW at traverse velocity of 16
   mm/min, the joint strength ratio to the ultimate tensile strength (UTS)
   of the AA5083 base metal (BM) was boosted up to similar to 94 \%, with
   an elongation reduction to 3\% and a Vickers hardness enhancement of
   250\% in the stir zone. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

Abstract = {Friction stir welding (FSW) is an innovative joining technology suitable
   for manufacture of magnesium welded lightweight structures. This paper
   presents tensile and fatigue crack growth rate (FCGR) behaviors of
   friction stir AZ31B-H24 magnesium alloy welded joints produced using two
   different pins, namely cylindrical and square pins at varying tool
   rotation rates of 910 rpm, 1500 rpm and 2280 rpm. Experiments conducted
   in this study included microstructural observations, Vickers
   microhardness measurements, tensile tests, residual stress measurements
   and FCGR tests. The results showed that increasing tool rotation rate
   increased ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the welded joints and the
   highest values of UTS were achieved at 2280 rpm giving 229.0 MPa for the
   cylindrical pin and 200.3 MPa for the square pin. In the middle tension
   M(T) fatigue specimens, FCGR of FSW joint fabricated using the square
   pin at 2280 rpm was lower in comparison to the weld produced by the
   cylindrical pin. Subsequently, in single edge crack tension (SECT)
   specimens, the higher FCGRs were observed as the crack propagated across
   heat affected zone (HAZ) followed by the crack growth retardation in the
   weld nugget zone (WNZ). These fatigue crack growth rate behaviors were
   likely dictated by the weld microstructure and residual stresses.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the impact of three distinct pin profiles, i.e.,
   threaded circular, triangular, and square, on the metallurgical
   characteristics of the FSWed joints of AA6061 and AZ91D. Joints between
   the two dissimilar alloys are needed of the hour in many lightweight
   structures. The metallurgical properties of various zones were perceived
   and analyzed using SEM, optical, and EBSD. The square pin profile
   generates a defect-free stir zone and contributes to a better materials
   flow of AZ91D and AA6061. The square pin profile achieved the maximum
   UTS of 144.32 MPa, while the threaded circular and triangular pin
   profile test specimen observed UTS of 126.54 and 114.74 MPa,
   respectively, a phenomenon potentially attributable to the emergence of
   a brittle beta-phase layer. The average grain size (AGS) of the
   triangular and threaded pin profile was 16.32 +/- 2.45 and 12.96 +/-
   1.32 mu m. The AGS of the square pin profile was 4.59 +/- 1.52 mu m.
   During FSW, the square pin profile generated significant frictional
   heating during the plunge stage, resulting in intense plastic
   deformation in the SZ and better-plasticized material flow.},

Abstract = {Microstructures, tensile properties and strain hardening behavior of a
   friction stir welded (FSWed)AZ31B-H24 magnesium alloy were studied at
   varying welding speeds, rotational rates and pin tool thread
   orientations. After friction stir welding (FSW) both yield strength (YS)
   and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) were observed to be lower but strain
   hardening exponent became much higher due to the presence of
   recrystallized grains in the stirred zone (SZ) and thermomechanically
   affected zone (TMAZ). The left-hand thread pin tool rotating clockwise
   generated good FSWed joints and mechanical properties due to the
   downward material flow close to the pin surface, while the right-hand
   thread pin tool turning clockwise caused an upward material flow and
   resulted in inferior joints. The YS and UTS increased and strain
   hardening exponent decreased with increasing welding speed. The YS as a
   function of grain sizes obeyed the Hall-Petch relationship well, and it
   also increased with decreasing rotational rate. Both YS and UTS were
   observed to increase linearly with increasing weld pitch (a ratio of
   welding speed to rotational rate). A significantly higher YS of similar
   to 170 MPa was achieved at a high weld pitch of 1.2 mm/rev, in
   comparison with that (similar to 110 MPa) using a weld pitch ranging
   from 0.0039 to 0.24 mm/rev. All the FSWed AZ31B-H24 joints failed
   in-between the SZ and TMAZ. Dimple-like ductile fracture characteristics
   appeared in the base metal, while some cleavage-like flat facets
   together with dimples and river marking were observed in the FSWed
   samples. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The microstructures and mechanical properties of friction stir welded
   (FSW) Al-Zn-Mg alloy plate under different travel speeds were
   investigated. Both the average grain sizes (AGSs) of the shoulder
   affected zone (SAZ), nugget zone (NZ), and the widths of
   thermo-mechanically affected zone (TMAZ) decreased with the increase of
   travel speed. Moreover, the AGSs of NZ are always about 60\% of that of
   SAZ at different travel speeds. The fractions of high-angle grain
   boundaries (HAGBs) in the FSW joints reduce with the distance away from
   the stir zone (SZ). Furthermore, the initial eta' strengthening
   precipitates in NZ and TMAZ dissolve and GP zones form during subsequent
   natural aging, so that the hardness is similar in the two zones. The
   precipitate evolution in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) at hardness minima
   are affected by travel speeds, which induce the hardness minima and
   ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of FSW joints and increase with the
   increase of travel speed, and a fracture tends to occur at hardness
   minima location of HAZ during tensile testing.},

Abstract = {The present investigation emphasizes studying the impact of the
   rotational tool speed and traverse speed on microstructure, mechanical
   properties, and corrosion behaviour of Al alloy AA6061 to Mg alloy AZ31B
   friction-stir welds. Results indicated that the use of the 1000 rpm
   rotation speed of the tool and 40 mm/min traverse speed led to increased
   weld strength and corrosion resistance. Owing to more heat generation,
   the surface of every friction stirs welded joint became rougher, and a
   keyhole can be observed. A maximum temperature of 311 degrees C was
   observed for 1000 rpm of rotation speed and 40 mm/min of traverse speed,
   and a minimum temperature of 191 degrees C was observed for 600 rpm of
   rotation speed and 80 mm/min of traverse speed. A minor tunnel defect
   can be partially observed at traverse speeds of 60 mm/min; the size of
   the tunnel defect becomes more prominent as the traverse speed rises to
   80 mm/min. The joint with little or no defects was extracted at any
   rotational tool speed and a low traverse speed of 40 mm/min. The maximum
   value of UTS of 121 MPa was observed due to the better mechanical
   interlocking phenomena. It is approximately 41\% of UTS of Al alloy
   AA6061 and 50\% of UTS of Mg alloy AZ31B. Frictional heat, heavy plastic
   distortion, and grain refinement in the nugget zone are the reasons for
   the higher hardness value found mostly in weld nuggets. The FSW
   specimens indicate a primarily brittle type of failure, and a fracture
   of the cleavage type was seen with an excessive volume of intermetallic
   layer. Compared to both alloy side weld regions, the Mg alloy area weld
   zone was more corroded and had more cracks and gaps than the Al alloy
   side.},

Abstract = {Friction stir welding is an efficient joining process for light metal
   alloys, offering benefits such as high joint efficiency and reduced
   grain sizes. This work is to investigate the process parameters that can
   improve the welding quality and reduce the brittle intermetallic
   compounds, including Al3Mg2 (\& beta;) and Al12Mg17 (\& gamma;) in the
   welded region. It was perceived that the process parameters influenced
   the morphological characteristics and input heat, thereby affecting the
   materialization of intermetallic compounds. The primary diffraction
   peaks of both Al and Mg were present in all the joints. Two specific
   intermetallic phases, Al3Mg2 and Al12Mg17, were formed as a result of
   the diffusion of Al and Mg atoms during welding. These intermetallic
   compounds were found in all the joints. The Al12Mg17 phase, when mixed
   with the Mg phase, tended to migrate towards the weld surface where the
   AZ91D plate was positioned. This migration might lead to constitutional
   liquation, which refers to the melting of specific phases during
   solidification, resulting in the materialization of eutectic
   microstructures. The highest ultimate tensile strength (UTS) value of
   116.64 MPa was achieved with a rotational tool speed of 800 r/min and a
   traverse speed of 20 mm/min. On the other hand, the lowest UTS value of
   68.32 MPa was observed with a rotational tool speed of 400 r/min and a
   traverse speed (TS) of 20 mm/min. It was noted that lower UTS values
   were associated with the materialization of dense layers of
   intermetallic compounds (Al12Mg17 and Mg + Al12Mg17) in the stir zone
   when using lower rotational tool speed and TS. It suggests that improper
   processing parameters can lead to the materialization of intermetallic
   compound in the stir zone, which subsequently decreases the mechanical
   properties of the weldments.},

Abstract = {material arrangements, with ZK60 or AZ31 in advancing side (AS), were
   applied. The results showed that the dissimilar plates with both
   material arrangements were joined successfully. No obvious defect was
   observed. Microstructure and texture variation across the joints were
   examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and electron backscatter
   diffraction (EBSD). The grains in stir zone (SZ) were significantly
   refined during FSW (similar to 8.7 p.m in AZ31 side and similar to
   2.71.un in ZK60 side). The second phases in ZK60 side were broken up,
   which contributed to grain refinement. Two-dimensional (2D) hardness
   maps across the normal direction (ND)-transverse direction (TD) sections
   in the joints were obtained. Clear boundary was observed between SZ and
   AZ31 base metal, but it was less clear between SZ and ZK60 base metal.
   The mixture of materials, grain refinement and broken up of particles
   were responsible for the sharp increasing of hardness between SZ and
   AZ31 base metal. The transverse ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the
   joints was 78-82\% of AZ31 base metal. The joints consistently fractured
   in the transition region of the AZ31 side. The sudden hardness decrease
   from SZ to AZ31 base metal might result in deformation incompatibility
   at the interface, which is considered as the main cause for the failing
   in the AZ31 side. In addition, the activation of twinning in SZ-side
   (with c-axis parallel to TD) and slip in the region adjacent to the
   SZ-side (with c-axis at similar to 45 degrees angle to TD) aggregated
   the deformation incompatibility in the transition region of the AZ31
   side. As a result, the break of the specimens started at the boundary of
   transition zone (TZ)/SZ. Many extension twins were observed in
   AZ31-SZ-side after fracture. Although the ZK60-SZ-side presented the
   similar texture with the AZ31-SZ-side, much less extension twins were
   observed in the former because of the hindering effects by the refined
   grains and secondary particles. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {This paper describes the microstructures and mechanical properties of
   dissimilar friction stir welds between A6N01-T5 and A7N01-T5 aluminum
   alloys for a feasibility study. The alloys were placed on the advancing
   side (AS) and retreating side (RS), respectively, and welded at a tool
   rotation speed of 1500 rpm and a traveling speed of 600 mm/min. Tensile
   tests were performed using specimens perpendicular / parallel to the
   welding direction. In the tensile tests of the specimens perpendicular
   to the welding direction, the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) was not
   significantly different from that of A6N01/A6N01 joints. However, based
   on the results of the specimens parallel to the welding direction, the
   UTS of A7N01/A6N01 (AS/RS) was higher by approximately 50 MPa when
   compared to A6N01/A7N01 (AS/RS). From the results of the microstructure
   observations, it is considered that a high proportion of the softening
   region of A7N01 was included in A7N01/A6N01 (AS/RS).},

Title = {Impact of Tool Pin Profile on Mechanical and Microstructural Properties
   of Friction Stir Welded Joints of AA2024 and AZ91D},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE},

Abstract = {In this work, the influence of three different pin profiles (square,
   triangular, and threaded circular pin profile) on the metallurgical
   characterization of the friction stir welded joints of AZ91D and AA2024
   was analyzed. Among the different pin profiles, the square pin profile
   revealed the most favorable joint properties in terms of both mechanical
   and metallurgical behavior. Conversely, the joint fabricated with the
   triangular pin profile exhibited the lowest tensile properties. The
   intermetallic compounds (IMCs) tended to migrate toward the weld surface
   adjacent to the AZ91D plate, potentially resulting in constitutional
   liquation during solidification. This liquation refers to the melting of
   specific phases, leading to the formation of eutectic microstructures.
   To minimize the effect of these IMCs, different types of tool pin were
   used and observed that the square pin profile results in defect-free
   joints. The maximum ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 153.27 MPa was
   observed for the square pin profile, while the lowest UTS value of
   124.81 MPa was observed for the triangular pin profile because lower UTS
   values were associated with dense layers of IMCs in the stir zone.},

Abstract = {Three rotation rates were selected for friction stir welded (FSW) rolled
   AZ31 plates, at a constant welding speed of 100 mm/minutes. As the
   rotation rate was increased from 800 and 2000 to 3500 rpm, the nugget
   shape varied from a basin-or ellipse-shaped homogeneous structure to a
   two-layer structure. The grain characteristic was similar in the nugget
   zones (NZs) at 800 and 2000 rpm, with the column-rotated basal plane.
   However, at 3500 rpm, the equiaxed fine grains and column-rotated basal
   plane were found in the lower zone of the two-layer structure, while
   elongated coarse grains and the basal plane with little inclination
   comparable to that in the parent material (PM) were detected in the
   upper zone. Tensile tests indicated that the fracture behaviors of the
   FSW AZ31 joints at 800 and 2000 rpm were similar with the weak zones
   being located at the NZ middle and along the boundary between the NZ and
   the thermo-mechanically affected zone, while contrasting fracture
   features were found at 3500 rpm. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of
   the joints increased as the rotation rate increased, with the highest
   UTS being about 95 pct of the PM at 3500 rpm. The variations in the
   strength and fracture behavior of the joints with the rotation rate were
   accounted for by the variation in the texture. DOI:

Abstract = {Magnesium is a popularly known class of biodegradable metallic
   biomaterials, and it has spent most of its time in corrosion
   environments that must be validated before it can be used in real bio
   applications. This work studies the adaptability of rare earth magnesium
   alloy (Mg-RE) ZE41 welds for in vitro bio applications. Magnesium rare
   earth ZE41 alloy plates were welded through a friction stir joining
   process. The fabrication of a defect-free and strong friction stir butt
   joint was confirmed by microscopic analysis and mechanical tests. The
   joint efficiency of 79.25\% was arrived from the tensile test based on
   ultimate tensile strength (UTS). The microhardness at WN, HAZ and base
   material were measured as 82, 63, and 70 respectively. A silicate
   electrolyte-based micro-arc oxidation (MAO) coating process was carried
   out on base and weld samples to study the corrosion behaviour of
   uncoated and coated samples in modified simulated body fluid (m-SBF).
   The average coating thickness of the samples was 40 \& mu;m. Then the
   processed samples were immersed in the m-SBF solution for 0.25 h, 72 h,
   and 168 h, and the degradation behaviour of all the samples was studied.
   The surface morphology and compositions were analysed through x-ray
   diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) on
   all the MAO-coated and uncoated bases as well as weld samples. The
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic
   polarisation (PDP) tests were employed to evaluate the electro-chemical
   induced corrosion behaviour of the samples. The results revealed that
   MAO-coated ZE41 welded samples have better corrosion mitigation
   properties with a corrosion rate of 12.45 mpy after 168 h of immersion
   than all other counterparts due to the compact oxide layer formation and
   further apatite mineral phase deposition that helps to delay the surface
   degradation of friction stir welded ZE41.},

Abstract = {This study examined the effect of traverse speed on the mechanical
   properties, corrosionresistance behavior, and microstructure of friction
   stir-welded A390/10 wt\% SiC compositesAA2024 Al alloy joints. The
   laminar flow of both materials was found to diminish in the stir zone
   (SZ) when the traverse speed of the tool increased from 40 to 80 mm/min,
   lowering their mixing rate. Large aspect ratio Si particles are broken
   by the tool pin-induced applied plastic strain, which turns them into
   refined equiaxed particles. Their aspect ratio remains unchanged in the
   SZ, despite their decreasing size. SiC and Si particles progressively
   come into view when moving from the AA2024 alloy's SZ to the composite
   workpieces. These changes happen abruptly as traverse speed increases
   due to the lack of an interfacial layer structure. The advancing side
   (AS)'s SZ grain size drops from 4.2 +/- 0.3 mu m to 1.2 +/- 0.2 mu m as
   the traverse speed drops from 80 to 40 mm/min. Increased traverse speed
   from 40 to 80 mm/min will result in a 5.8\% decrease in elongation
   percentage (EP) and 8.4\%, 36\%, and 10.3\% increases in the ultimate
   tensile strength (UTS), corrosion resistance, and yield strength,
   respectively.},
